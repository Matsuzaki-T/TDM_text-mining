14699459,Use of total lymphocyte count for monitoring response to antiretroviral therapy.,"The CD4 cell count has become a key laboratory measurement in the management of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease. In ideal situations, HIV-infected persons are followed up longitudinally with serial CD4 cell counts to determine disease progression, risk for opportunistic infection, and the need for prophylactic or therapeutic intervention. However, the use of the CD4 cell count in resource-limited settings is often not possible because of lack of availability and high cost. Thus, other laboratory markers have been proposed as substitutes for the CD4 cell count. The data regarding the clinical utility of the total lymphocyte count (TLC) as a potential surrogate marker of immune function in patients with HIV disease are examined. The role of the TLC in the initiation of antiretroviral therapy and opportunistic infection prophylaxis, as well as the role of the TLC in monitoring the response to antiretroviral therapy, are also addressed."

15006189,Therapeutic drug monitoring of antiretroviral therapy.,"The concept of managing pharmacotherapy based on plasma drug concentrations has been used for decades in a variety of clinical settings. The interest in therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of antiretroviral drugs has grown significantly since highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) became a standard of care in clinical practice. A primary characteristic of TDM of antiretroviral drugs is that multiple agents are concomitantly used in HAART regimens. Inadequate drug concentrations may lead to evolution of drug resistance mutations and endanger present and future treatment options. A number of clinical trials have demonstrated that drug serum concentrations are an important factor in response to therapy for HIV, but whether TDM will become a tool for the routine management of HIV infection remains to be determined. This review includes an illustrative case report of measuring concentrations of antiretroviral drugs in a pediatric patient."
15006193,Growth patterns reflect response to antiretroviral therapy in HIV-positive infants: potential utility in resource-poor settings.,"Laboratory monitoring of HIV-infected children is the current standard of care in the United States to guide the appropriate use of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Although ART is becoming a reality in some developing countries, laboratory monitoring of ART is costly, necessitating creative approaches to monitoring. As an initial step to guide monitoring of HIV progression in low resource settings, we assessed the utility of the physical examination to predict clinical progression of HIV. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of HIV-infected children using data from Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group Protocol 300. We developed a clinical predictive model, and compared the utility of the clinical model to the change in HIV RNA viral load as diagnostic tests of ART failure. The clinical model incorporated treatment regimen, age, and height velocity: a three-level clinical predictive model provided likelihood ratios of 0.3, 3.9, and 14. For decline in RNA the likelihood ratios were 0.2 (> 1 log decline), 1.4, and 3.5 (> log increase). We developed a simple clinical predictive model that was able to predict clinical progression of HIV after initiation of new ART. The clinical model performed similarly to using changes in HIV RNA viral load. These data should be validated internationally and prospectively, because the test subjects were from a resource rich environment and growth patterns in undernourished children may be impacted differently by HIV and its treatment. The model was most pertinent to children 36 months of age or younger, and was conducted in children receiving monotherapy and dual therapy."
15040540,Effect of individual cognitive behaviour intervention on adherence to antiretroviral therapy: prospective randomized trial.,"OBJECTIVE: A high level of adherence to antiretroviral therapy is required for complete suppression of HIV replication, immunological and clinical effectiveness. We investigated whether cognitive behaviour therapy can improve medication adherence. DESIGN: Prospective randomized 1-year trial. SETTING: Collaboration of HIV university outpatient clinic and psychotherapists in private practice. PARTICIPANTS: 60 HIV-infected persons on stable antiretroviral combination therapy and viral load below 50 copies/ml. INTERVENTION: Cognitive behaviour intervention in individual patients, in addition to standard of care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Feasibility and acceptance of intervention; adherence to therapy assessed using medication event monitoring system (MEMS) and self-report questionnaire; virological failure; psychosocial measures. RESULTS: The median number of sessions for cognitive behaviour intervention per patient during the 1-year trial was 11 (range 2-25). At months 10-12, mean adherence to therapy as assessed using MEMS was 92.8% in the intervention and 88.9% in the control group (P=0.2); the proportion of patients with adherence > or = 95% was 70 and 50.0% (P=0.014), respectively. While there was no significant deterioration of adherence during the study in the intervention arm, adherence decreased by 8.7% per year (P=0.006) in the control arm. No differences between the intervention group and standard of care group were found regarding virological outcome. Compared with the control group, participants in the intervention group perceived a significant improvement of their mental health during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive behavioural support in addition to standard of care of HIV-infected persons is feasible in routine practice, and can improve medication adherence and mental health."

15077862,Highly active antiretroviral therapy in neonates and young infants.,"As techniques for early diagnosis of HIV-infected neonates and young infants become more sophisticated, neonatal nurses will be responsible for administering a variety of antiretroviral agents. Infants infected with HIV are likely to be placed on combination therapy, with the goal of suppressing viral replication and stabilizing the immune system. Combination therapy also reduces the risk of resistance mutations associated with monotherapy. The pharmacokinetics of antiretroviral agents in neonates is under study in a variety of PACTG protocols. However, the pharmacokinetics of most antiretroviral agents in premature infants has not been studied. With the exception of zidovudine, specific dosing for these agents in the preterm population is not known. The long-term effects of antiretroviral agents on growth and development also require further study. Knowledge of the management of HIV in all populations is expanding rapidly. Access to and utilization of HIV/AIDS-related resources are essential. The reader is encouraged to check for updated recommendations for the management of HIV-infected infants on the Internet at http://AIDSinfo. nih.gov."
15090796,"Effect of prolonged discontinuation of successful antiretroviral therapy on CD4 T cells: a controlled, prospective trial.","OBJECTIVE: To compare continuous highly active antiretroviral therapy with a CD4 cell count-driven structured treatment interruption (STI) strategy. The primary end-point was the proportion of subjects maintaining CD4 cell count > 400 x 10 cells/l. Secondary end-points were to identify the dynamic and predictive variables of CD4 cell loss. METHODS: The BASTA study is a randomized, controlled, prospective trial. Patients with CD4 cell counts > 800 x 10 cells/l were enrolled and the immunological threshold to resume therapy was set to the lower normal limit of CD4 cells for HIV-uninfected adults. RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients were randomized and followed for 64 weeks. At baseline, all had undetectable plasma HIV RNA and their mean CD4 cell count was 1077 x 10 cells/l. None of the patients showed a disease progression or any AIDS-defining event. At each time point, the proportion of subjects in the STI group that had a CD4 cell count < 400 x 10 cells/l was not statistically different from the control group. In all cases, the 95% confidence interval for this difference was smaller than +/-10%. However, 57% of patients with nadir CD4 cell count 200-350 x 10 cells/l reached a CD4 cell count < 400 x 10 cells/l. This was statistically different (P = 0.02) from the nearly 90% of patients with a nadir CD4 cell count 350-500 x 10 cells/l who maintained a CD4 cell count of > 400 x 10 cells/l. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged STI in patients with fully suppressed virus and marked immune reconstitution is generally safe. The main predictor of CD4 cell decline is the nadir CD4 cell count. Pulse therapy warrants further careful prospective evaluation to investigate virological and clinical outcomes over a very long period."

15186710,Preventing and managing antiretroviral drug resistance.,"Development of resistance to antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) is a major impediment to optimum treatment of HIV-1 infection. Although resistance testing can help to select subsequent regimens when virologic failure occurs, cross-resistance, which affects all classes of ARVs, may make it more difficult to achieve optimum control of HIV. We have known for some time that our first choice of antiretroviral therapy offers the best chance to control HIV replication and that initial therapy should be selected with an eye on future options. Potency is the first line of defense against the development of resistance. Other factors that affect resistance development include: tolerability, potential for optimum adherence, and genetic and pharmacologic barriers to development of resistance. If resistance emerges, only a single drug may be affected initially, and a rapid change in ARVs may preserve the efficacy of other components. One cautionary note is that we can no longer assume that a patient\'s HIV is fully susceptible to all ARVs even in the initial regimen. Transmission of drug-resistant HIV means that the genetic composition may be that of an ""experienced"" virus with reduced susceptibility to ARVs. Resistance testing at the time of transmission is most likely to reveal this resistance, but over time the dominant genetic pattern may revert to wild-type, and be missed by resistance testing. Because ""archived"" resistant HIV may emerge quickly once treatment is initiated, we need to keep this in mind when selecting initial therapy."
15203426,Clinical assessment of medication adherence among HIV-infected children: examination of the Treatment Interview Protocol (TIP).,"This paper presents findings of a multi-site study designed to document: (1) caregivers' regimen knowledge; (2) barriers to adherence; and (3) the relationships between adherence, regimen knowledge and barriers. Fifty-one predominantly female, African American parents and caregivers of HIV-infected children completed the Treatment Interview Protocol (TIP), a brief, structured interview designed to assess regimen knowledge and barriers to adherence. TIP data were compared to information obtained from medical records and pharmacy refill histories. Forty-nine per cent of children were considered adherent, defined as > or = 90% refill rate, which was significantly associated with virologic response. Significant regimen knowledge deficits were observed among caregivers, and inaccurate identification of prescribed medications was significantly associated with adherence. Caregivers identified 21 barriers to adherence, and poor adherence was significantly related to the number of barriers reported. Results indicate that the TIP is a successful tool for identifying regimen knowledge, potential adherence barriers and adherence problems. Results suggest that the TIP could be integrated into clinical practice as a quick, effective tool to identify poor adherers and guide interventions and treatment decision making."

The manuscipt not only focuses on an update on TDM in HIV infection but also provides the latest information on tandem mass spectrometric methods for antiretroviral drug quantification. Also discussed are the preliminary new and original data on free antiretroviral drug measurement in both plasma and saliva.
15228151,Therapeutic drug monitoring in children with HIV/AIDS.,"In this paper we present an overview on the use of TDM in the treatment of HIV-1-infected children. The processes of growth and development have a significant impact on drug metabolism. The use of TDM makes it possible to optimize plasma drug concentrations of antiretroviral drugs. This is important when one considers that the levels of viral suppression and drug toxicity in adults and children are associated with the plasma concentration of PIs and NNRTIs. Indeed, in clinical practice the use of TDM in the treatment of HIV-1-infected children has favorable results. However, there is a serious shortage of population reference values of antiretroviral medication in children. Targeting plasma drug levels in children to adult reference values may be insufficient because of the unique features of HIV infection in children. Apart from its primary function for dose optimization, TDM can also be used as a tool to assess adherence to antiviral medication. One should, however, be cautious to base assumptions on plasma levels alone because aberrant plasma levels may also be the result of other factors such as changes in nutritional habits, drug-drug interactions, or changing gastric motility. We conclude that TDM is a useful tool in the treatment of HIV-1-infected children. Additional data are needed to establish child-specific reference values and to assess the optimal method of TDM."
15236622,Determination of indinavir and nelfinavir trough plasma concentration efficacy thresholds according to virological response in HIV-infected patients.,"BACKGROUND: There is evidence to suggest a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship in HIV-infected patients receiving protease inhibitor (PI)-containing highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART); however, the effective trough PI plasma concentrations achieved have not been precisely determined. METHODS: The relationship between HIV viral load and concomitant PI trough plasma concentration (C(trough)) was evaluated in 101 patients receiving at least 4 months of thrice daily indinavir (IDV)-containing (n=68) or nelfinavir (NFV)-containing (n=33) HAART. The more discriminating C(trough) efficacy thresholds were determined statistically for each PI by using the raw C(trough) and the time-corrected C(trough), using the precise delay since the last PI intake and the half-life of each PI. RESULTS: For IDV (P=0.002) and NFV (P=0.019) median C(trough) levels were higher in patients with undetectable viral load [0.23 mg/L (n=30) and 2.3 mg/L (n=16) respectively] than in patients with detectable viral load [0.11 mg/L (n=38) and 0.6 mg/L (n=17) respectively]. C(trough) levels of IDV (r=-0.45; P<0.0001) and NFV (r=-0.43; P=0.011) were correlated with the concomitant viral load. The more discriminating C(trough) efficacy thresholds were estimated statistically as 0.12 mg/L for IDV and 0.5 mg/L for NFV. When C(trough) values were time-corrected, the C(trough) efficacy thresholds, 8 h after the last intake, were 0.15 mg/L for IDV and 0.65 mg/L for NFV. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the importance of achieving minimal effective C(trough) to improve the virological efficacy of PI-containing HAART, and specify the target concentrations for IDV and NFV."
15286240,Evaluation and treatment of the human immunodeficiency virus-1--exposed infant.,"In developed countries, care and treatment are available for pregnant women and infants that can decrease the rate of perinatal human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection to 2% or less. The pediatrician has a key role in prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1 by identifying HIV-exposed infants whose mothers' HIV infection was not diagnosed before delivery, prescribing antiretroviral prophylaxis for these infants to decrease the risk of acquiring HIV-1 infection, and promoting avoidance of HIV-1 transmission through human milk. In addition, the pediatrician can provide care for HIV-exposed infants by monitoring them for early determination of HIV-1 infection status and for possible short- and long-term toxicities of antiretroviral exposure, providing chemoprophylaxis for Pneumocystis pneumonia, and supporting families living with HIV-1 infection by providing counseling to parents or caregivers."

15328077,Population pharmacokinetics of indinavir in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus.,"Indinavir is currently used at a fixed dose of 800 mg either three times a day or twice a day in combination with 100 mg of ritonavir. Dosage individualization based on plasma concentration monitoring might, however, be indicated. This study aimed to assess the pharmacokinetic profile of indinavir in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus to characterize interpatient and intrapatient variability and to build up a Bayesian approach for dosage adaptation. A population analysis was performed with the NONMEM computer program with 569 plasma samples from a cohort of 239 unselected patients receiving indinavir. A one-compartment model with first-order absorption was adapted, and the influences of clinical characteristics on oral clearance (CL) and distribution volume (V) were examined. Predicted average drug exposure and trough and peak concentrations were derived for each patient and correlated with efficacy and toxicity markers. The population estimates of CL were 32.4 liters/h for female and 42.0 liters/h for male patients; oral V was 65.7 liters; and the rate constant of absorption (K(a)) was 1.0 h(-1). CL decreased by 63% with ritonavir intake and was moderately correlated to body weight. Both interpatient variability, best assigned to oral CL (coefficient of variation [CV], 39%) and K(a) (CV, 67%), and intrapatient variability were large (CV, 41%; standard deviation, 670 microg/liter). In conclusion, initial indinavir dosage should be decided according to ritonavir intake and sex, prior to plasma concentration measurements. The high interpatient pharmacokinetic variability represents an argument for therapeutic drug monitoring."
15337632,Follow-up measurements of Nevirapine plasma levels over a prolonged period.,"Over a period of more than four years of treatment, 177 Nevirapine plasma levels were taken from 27 patients. The values showed a high inter-patient variability and a lower intra-patient variability. Differences in body weight turned out to be the main reason for inter-patient variability. Treatment over a prolonged period did not result in any change in plasma concentrations. Adjusting dosage by means of therapeutic drug monitoring would appear to be a reasonable way of maximising patient benefit from treatment."
15362661,Atazanavir enhances saquinavir hard-gel concentrations in a ritonavir-boosted once-daily regimen.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the pharmacokinetics of saquinavir hard-gel capsules/ritonavir/atazanavir co-administered once daily at 1600/100/300 mg in HIV-infected individuals. METHODS: Eighteen patients receiving saquinavir/ritonavir switched to 1600/100 mg once daily a minimum of 3 days before the study. On study day 1, levels of saquinavir and ritonavir were determined over 24 h. Atazanavir (300 mg once daily) was then added to the regimen. On day 11, a pharmacokinetic analysis was performed. Atazanavir was discontinued on day 32. Drug concentrations were measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Geometric mean ratios (GMR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to compare saquinavir and ritonavir pharmacokinetic parameters, with and without atazanavir. A safety analysis was performed at screening, days 1, 11, 32 and follow-up. RESULTS: After the addition of atazanavir, statistically significant increases in saquinavir trough plasma concentration (Ctrough GMR, 95% CI 2.12, 1.72-3.50), maximum plasma concentration (Cmax 1.42, 1.24-1.94), area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0-24 h (AUC0-24 1.60, 1.35-2.43) and ritonavir Cmax (1.58, 1.32-2.08), AUC0-24 (1.41, 1.22-1.74) were observed. The pharmacokinetics of atazanavir compared with those obtained in patients receiving atazanavir/ritonavir without saquinavir. Four patients developed scleral icterus and two jaundice. Total and unconjugated bilirubin increased approximately fivefold during atazanavir therapy. CONCLUSION: The addition of atazanavir to saquinavir/ritonavir increased saquinavir Ctrough, Cmax and AUC0-24 by 112, 42 and 60%. Ritonavir Cmax and AUCo-24 increased by 34 and 41%. The regimen was well tolerated, with no significant change in laboratory parameters, except for the occurrence of hyperbilirubinemia."

METHODS: Patients with a viral load>1000 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL and an unchanged antiretroviral therapy regimen over the last 3 months were randomized into two groups: a genotypic group (G) and a geno-pharmacological group (GP). Treatment was selected by an expert committee according to genotypic resistance testing (the G and GP groups) and TDM (the GP group) at week 4. Treatment could be modified at each visit according to toxicity, poor virological response and TDM. Results of TDM were withheld from the G group until week 12. The primary endpoint of the study was the percentage of patients with viral load<200 copies/mL at week 12. RESULTS: A total of 134 patients were randomized in the study, with 67 in each group, and included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis. At baseline, median values were as follows: viral load (log(10) copies/mL): G=4.1, GP=4.0; CD4 cell count (cells/microL): G=292, GP=294; and number of prior drugs: G=7, GP=8. The median number of resistance mutations was five in the G group [nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs)=three; non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs)=one; protease inhibitors (PI)=one] and seven in the GP group (NRTI=four; NNRTI=two; PI=one). At week 8, treatment was adjusted according to the TDM in 13 of the 67 patients in the GP group (19%). By ITT missing equal failure analysis at week 12, and after only one intervention according to plasma concentration results, a viral load<200 copies/mL was achieved in 30 of the 67 patients (45%) in the G group and in 29 of the 67 patients (43%) in the GP group (not significant). In the multivariate analysis, only prior exposure to at least two PIs at baseline gave a poor response to subsequent antiretroviral therapy. At week 24, a viral load<200 copies/mL was achieved in 35 of the 67 patients (52%) in the G group and in 40 of the 67 patients (60%) in the GP group. CONCLUSIONS: A statistically significant benefit of using TDM was not found in this short-term study where patients appeared to be adherent. However, combining genotypic resistance testing with the use of an expert committee to monitor subsequent therapy individually in patients with multiple resistance mutations was associated with high antiviral efficacy."

We explore whether lopinavir (LPV) and ritonavir (RTV) exposures can be estimated with limited sampling for patients taking twice-daily LPV/RTV. One hundred and one PK profiles from 81 patients, most receiving salvage therapies including twice-daily LPV/RTV, were obtained for the analysis. After a minimum of 2 weeks on a stable regimen, blood was drawn immediately before and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 hours after a timed medication dose. Plasma drug concentrations were determined by a validated HPLC-MS-MS assay. Peak concentrations, evening troughs, and AUC0-12 h were entered into linear and log10-log10 linear regression models to determine the best correlation with LPV and RTV plasma concentrations using a maximum of 2 time points. The accuracy and precision of PK parameter estimates of the resultant models were tested on data collected for an additional 25 patients. Twelve models using various combinations of 2 timed LPV concentrations afforded accurate (maximum % bias = -6.45) and precise (relative standard deviation < 15%) estimates for the LPV peak concentration or AUC0-12h. Four sets of 2 concentrations provided simultaneous estimates of both PK parameters, with the best estimates derived from data collected at 2 and 6 hours postdose. Evening trough concentrations were the best estimators of the daily nadir; however, no adequate substitute for collecting blood 12 hours postdose emerged from this analysis."

15456085,The NIQ of lopinavir is predictive of a 48-week virological response in highly treatment-experienced HIV-1-infected subjects treated with a lopinavir/ritonavir-containing regimen.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the normalized inhibitory quotient (NIQ) of lopinavir (LPV) as a predictor of 48-week virological responses to a lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV)-containing regimen in highly treatment-experienced patients. DESIGN: We calculated the NIQ for 59 patients who completed 48 weeks' treatment and assessed the factors predicting a week-48 virological response. METHODS: The NIQ was calculated by dividing each subject's IQ (LPV Ctrough/fold change in LPV susceptibility, as assessed by VirtualPhenotype) by a reference IQ (mean population LPV Ctrough/fold change in LPV IC50, as assessed by VirtualPhenotype). HIV-1 RNA was assessed by NASBA (quantification limit: 80 copies/ml). The general linear model and multiple logistic regression, respectively, were used to estimate the independent predictors of a change in viral load and HIV-1 RNA <80 copies/ml. RESULTS: The median (interquartile range) baseline levels of CD4+ cells and HIV-1 RNA were 251 (141-385) cells/microl and 4.85 (4.49-5.23) log10 copies/ml, respectively. The median NIQ was 2.2 (0.5-14). At week 48, the median decrease in HIV-1 RNA was 1.4 (0.59-2.79) log10 copies/ml (P<0.0001), with 24 subjects (41%) reaching <80 copies/mi. Baseline HIV-1 RNA (P=0.001), CD4+ cells (P=0.002) and NIQ (P=0.0006) independently predicted the week-48 change in viral load, whereas baseline CD4+ cells (P=0.011) and NIQ (P=0.009) independently predicted a week-48 HIV-1 RNA level of <80 copies/ml. CONCLUSION: The LPV NIQ independently predicts virological responses to an LPV/RTV-containing regimen in highly treatment-experienced HIV-1-infected patients."
15472796,Usefulness of therapeutic drug monitoring of antiretrovirals in routine clinical practice.,"BACKGROUND: Clinical trials have shown that therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of antiretrovirals (ARV) improves patient care. However, little is known about the usefulness of TDM in routine practice. METHOD: We reviewed all the trough concentrations of protease inhibitors and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors that were performed for therapeutic failure, suspected drug toxicity, or routine purposes. RESULTS: Between 1998 and 2001, 146 TDMs were done in 109 HIV patients. Of the 48 patients with therapeutic failure, 62% had resistance to ARV with adequate ARV concentrations, 16% had insufficient drug exposure without any ARV resistance mutations, and 16% combined both resistance and suboptimal drug concentrations. Subsequent therapeutic interventions (increasing adherence and/or changing HAART) resulted in an undetectable viral load in 37.5% of the patients (14/48). Five (24%) of 21 patients with suspected drug toxicity had high drug concentrations associated with side effects. In all the cases, adverse events regressed after reduction of drug dosage. Of the 77 TDMs done for routine purposes, 26% were outside the therapeutic range. CONCLUSION: The data show that TDM of ARVs in the clinical setting provides important information that can be used to improve the management of HIV patients receiving antiretroviral therapy."
15503932,HIV update: emerging clinical evidence and a review of recommendations for the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy.,"PURPOSE: This supplement will focus on recent trial data concerning the efficacy of certain nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-based highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimens, the most recent guidelines from the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) for the timing of antiretroviral (ARV) therapy initiation, and recommended ARV drug classes for managing treatment-naive patients with HIV. SUMMARY: When choosing an initial regimen for the treatment of HIV, it is important to carefully consider therapeutic goals. These goals include choosing HAART that is likely to maximally suppress viral replication, maintain or restore immunologic function, improve quality of life, and reduce HIV-related morbidity and mortality. The evidence-based DHHS guidelines recommend HAART regimens that are non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)- or protease inhibitor (PI)-based. DHHS, however, does not recommend the use of triple-NRTI therapy for the initial treatment of HIV unless a preferred or alternative NNRTI- or PI-based regimen cannot be used. This recommendation concerning triple-NRTI therapy is supported by results from recent trials that demonstrated inferior outcomes with triple-NRTI-containing regimens compared with NNRTI- or PI-based HAART regimens. The timing for initiation of ARV therapy continues to change over time as the DHHS guidelines have evolved. Although the benefits of initiating ARV when CD4 cell count is < 200 cells/mm3 are well established, the use of early versus late initiation of ARV therapy in patients with CD4 cell counts > 200 cells/mm3 has its own benefits and drawbacks. CONCLUSION: To successfully manage people with HIV, it is crucial to find a balance between ARV potency, tolerability, safety, and convenience while providing durable viral suppression."
15509183,Practical guidelines to interpret plasma concentrations of antiretroviral drugs.,"Several relationships have been reported between antiretroviral drug concentrations and the efficacy of treatment, and toxicity. Therefore, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) may be a valuable tool in improving the treatment of HIV-1-infected patients in daily practice. In this regard, several measures of exposure have been studied, e.g. trough and maximum concentrations, concentration ratios and the inhibitory quotient. However, it has not been unambiguously established which pharmacokinetic parameter should be monitored to maintain optimal viral suppression. Each pharmacokinetic parameter has its pros and cons. Many factors can affect the pharmacokinetics of antiretroviral agents, resulting in variability in plasma concentrations between and within patients. Therefore, plasma concentrations should be considered on several occasions. In addition, the interpretation of the drug concentration of a patient should be performed on an individual basis, taking into account the clinical condition of the patient. Important factors herewith are viral load, immunology, occurrence of adverse events, resistance pattern and comedication. In spite of the described constraints, the aim of this review is to provide a practical guide for TDM of antiretroviral agents. This article outlines pharmacokinetic target values for the HIV protease inhibitors amprenavir, atazanavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir and saquinavir, and the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors efavirenz and nevirapine. Detailed advice is provided on how to interpret the results of TDM of these drugs."
15537695,The intracellular pharmacology of antiretroviral protease inhibitors.,"Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of antiretroviral protease inhibitors (PIs) has been suggested to have the potential to both reduce toxicity and optimize individual therapy. However, the major target of PIs is within cells infected with HIV. Therefore clinical outcome ultimately must be related to intracellular drug concentrations since antiviral activity of PIs is highly correlated with intracellular concentrations in vitro. Intracellular pharmacokinetics provides information regarding drug disposition in a compartment where HIV replication occurs and combined with plasma data may be useful in understanding therapeutic failure in relation to cellular resistance. In order to improve therapeutic efficacy, it is therefore important that the intracellular pharmacokinetics of drugs, such as PIs, is studied in addition to plasma pharmacokinetics. Multidrug resistance transporters may result in a lower cellular concentration of drug via an efflux mechanism, thus contributing to sanctuary site formation. However, conclusive proof that transporters contribute to clinical drug resistance is still lacking, although recent studies have attempted to address this issue. In relation to host and cellular factors, this review considers several issues involved in influencing intracellular drug concentrations and discusses the intracellular levels of PIs recently published from cellular studies."
15544452,Improving HIV infection management using antiretroviral plasma drug levels monitoring: a clinician's point of view.,"Due to genetic and environmental factors, there are wide inter-patient differences when measuring drug exposure to a standard dose. If there is a relationship between drug exposure and efficacy or toxicity, this inter-patient variability carries various risks to develop toxicity or failure. Therapeutic drug monitoring is an attempt to adjust the dose to obtain a level within a therapeutic range consisting in a minimum plasma concentration needed to be efficacious and a maximum plasma concentration not to exceed to avoid toxicity. Many studies have shown a relationship between various pharmacokinetic parameters and drug toxicity or efficacy for HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) proves to be a useful tool to assess adherence, to investigate drug-drug interactions between antiretroviral (ARV) drugs or with co-medications, to prevent some ARV drug toxicities, to adjust the dosage in particular populations, and to increase ARV efficacy of some drugs in naive patients. The integration of virological and pharmacological parameters, using inhibitory quotients, looks promising to improve therapy in ARV-experienced patients. Effective and non-toxic target concentrations will be determined for all present and future antiretroviral drugs covering the extended spectrum of naive patients to multiple failures. In this article, we review the rationale of TDM for antiretroviral drugs, the retrospective and prospective studies assessing plasma drug concentrations in relation with antiretroviral toxicity or efficacy, and the actually recommended or proposed indications for TDM. We also highlight the benefits and limits of this tool as an adjunct in the care of HIV-infected patients."

15646076,Clinical pharmacology of antiretroviral therapy.,"Antiretroviral therapy represents by all means a new branch of anti-infective chemotherapy, and in order to describe the mode of action of antiretrovirals, a series of inferences from anti-bacterial chemotherapy were made. The currently available antiretroviral agents can be classified as time-dependent drugs, and therefore the key pharmacokinetic parameter adopted in their clinical-pharmacological assessment is the concentration at the end of the dosing interval (Ctrough). By focusing on this parameter, the application of Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) allows for the successful individual tailoring of the drug dosage in some clinical circumstances, such as treatment of drug-resistant infections, drug-drug interactions and side effects. While this procedure has now been sufficiently standardized for protease inhibitors (PIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), no clinical applications are yet recognized for nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (N/NtRTIs) and fusion inhibitors. The main unfavourable peculiarity of HIV infection, such as the need for lifelong treatment, is one of the reasons why increasing attention is being paid to pharmacological aspects of antiretroviral therapy. Issues like treatment potency, maintenance over time of the immunovirological benefit and long-term side effects require intensive pharmacological investigation in order to obtain the information on which basing the most convenient strategy to be adopted for the therapeutical management of this condition."
15646078,Temporal change in the use of genotypic resistance testing over the years 1999--2003.,"The evaluation of resistance test perception by clinicians over the years 1999--2003 was assessed in an Italian cohort. The results on 2233 samples from 1416 HIV-1 infected patients show an increase in HIV-1 drug resistance test requests over time, with a plateau reached in the last three years. CD4-cell count at the time of genotype request progressively increased. In particular, the median CD4 cell count of drug-treated patients increased from 221x10(6) cells/l [interquartile range (IQR): 109-368] in 1999 to 296x10(6) cells/l (IQR: 166-478) in 2003 (p<0.0001). At the same time, plasma HIV-RNA level progressively decreased from a median of 103,500 copies/ml (IQR: 37,250-260,000) in 1999 to 9,444 copies/ml (IQR: 2,086-41,281) in 2003 (p<0.0001). Overall, data suggest that the genotype test is increasingly considered, and requested also for patients at earlier stages of drug history and/or at less severe disease stage."

A total of 119 HIV+ subjects were included in our study: 67 HIV+ patients, 32 HIV+ and HCV-positive (HCV+) patients without cirrhosis, and 20 HIV+ and HCV+ patients with cirrhosis. Most of the enrolled patients (chronically treated) were taking NFV at the standard dosage of 1,250 mg twice a day. To assay plasma NFV and M8 concentrations, patients underwent serial plasma samplings during the dosing interval at steady state. Plasma NFV and M8 concentrations were measured simultaneously by a high-performance liquid chromatography method with UV detection. The HIV+ and HCV+ patients with and without cirrhosis had significantly lower NFV oral clearances than the HIV+ and HCV-negative individuals (28 and 58% lower, respectively; P < 0.05), which translated into higher areas under the concentration-time curves for cirrhotic and noncirrhotic patients. The NFV absorption rate was significantly lower in cirrhotic patients, resulting in a longer time to the maximum concentration in serum. The mean ratios of the M8 concentration/NFV concentration were significantly lower (P < 0.05) in HIV+ and HCV+ subjects with cirrhosis (0.06 +/- 0.074) than in the subjects in the other two groups. The mean ratios for M8 and NFV were not statistically different between HIV+ and HCV-negative patients (0.16 +/- 0.13) and HIV+ and HCV+ patients without cirrhosis (0.24 +/- 0.17), but the interpatient variability was high. Our results indicate that the pharmacokinetics of NFV and M8 are altered in HIV+ and HCV+ patients, especially those with liver cirrhosis. Therefore, there may be a role for therapeutic drug monitoring in individualizing the NFV dosage in HIV-HCV-coinfected patients."
15698519,Drug monitoring and viral response to lopinavir/ritonavir or saquinavir/ritonavir containing regimens in individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1.,"The aim of this study was to correlate results of therapeutic drug monitoring, genotypic resistance and viral response to lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) or saquinavir/ritonavir (SQV/r) containing antiretroviral regimens. The retrospective short-term study included 20 patients with LPV/r and 20 patients with SQV/r containing highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). At baseline 7 LPV/r patients and 10 SQV/r patients had CD4+T cell counts above 410 cells/microl. After 6 months CD4+T cells had doubled in 5 LPV/r and 2 SQV/r patients. In LPV/r patients the mean serum concentration of lopinavir (LPV) was 2.6 ppm and 67% of all LPV/r samples had 50 or fewer viral copies/ml. In SQV/r patients the mean serum concentration of saquinavir (SQV) was 2.1 ppm. 79% of all SQV/r samples had 50 or fewer viruses/ml. Pharmacoenhanced regimens efficiently suppress human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and the risk of developing resistance mutations is therefore reduced. The implementation of drug monitoring is an additional tool to determine optimal treatment conditions."
15731738,Therapeutic drug monitoring of antiretroviral agents scenario.,"The efficacy of antiretroviral treatment (ART) may be limited by pharmacological factors. Dose-response relationship exists for many antiretroviral agents, and failure to maintain adequate concentrations may allow the development of viral resistance, thereby decreasing the probability of response of current and subsequent therapies. Fixed dosage of antiretroviral agents may result in different systemic and intracellular concentrations of drugs (interindividual variability). Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) consists of individualising dosages with the aim of maximising the efficacy of treatment while minimising its toxicity. The combination of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships for antiretroviral therapy and the presence of a wide interpatient variability in drug exposure support the application of TDM in HIV-infected individuals. Prospective clinical trials assessing the clinical usefulness of this strategy have shown contradictory results, pointing out the need to consider different issues when performing TDM of ART. Pharmacological and resistance data should be combined in one parameter (inhibitory quotient) in antiretroviral-experienced patients. Protease inhibitors exhibit a moderate to high degree of binding to plasma proteins, and in vitro inhibitory concentrations need to be corrected by this factor. The best method to individualize the dosage regimen has not been identified yet. Finally, participation of different laboratories in external cross-validation programmes is crucial to ensure that results are accurate."
15737947,"Atazanavir for treatment of HIV infection in clinical routine: efficacy, pharmacokinetics and safety.","INTRODUCTION: Atazanavir (ATV) is a novel protease inhibitor that has been recently introduced into therapy of HIV infection. Currently there is little data on ATV therapy from daily practice. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we report on ATV efficacy and safety in clinical routine. Drug monitoring was performed consisting of unscheduled single measurements and a 4-hour-profile. Trough concentration of >80 ng/ml and peak concentration of 2000-6000 ng/ml were regarded as sufficient. RESULTS: Between May 2003 and April 2004, ATV treatment was started in 42 patients, mean observation time was 32 weeks (6-53). Mean age was 45.6 years, 38% had prior AIDS, viral load was undetectable in 73%. Important side effects were minor or moderate diarrhea (27%) and fatigue (15%). ATV was discontinued in 10% due to side effects or malignant diseases. No significant influence on mean values of cholesterol, triglycerides, liver enzymes, CD4-cell-count, and HI-viral load was seen. Virologic failure occurred in 13% of patients, all of them were PI-experienced. Pharmacokinetic data are available for 32 patients, all patients had sufficient trough levels. 30% with unboosted ATV and 21% with boosted ATV had peak plasma concentrations below the level defined as sufficient. Mean trough levels, plasma profile and AUC did not differ significantly between groups with non-boosted versus boosted ATV regimes but showed a wide inter-patient variability. CONCLUSIONS: ATV treatment of HIV-infected patients with or without a RTV booster was safe and effective in clinical routine. Drug levels were sufficient in the majority of cases. The variability of pharmacokinetic results in our sample supports therapeutic drug monitoring in patients treated with ATV."

15772145,Patient adherence to prescribed antimicrobial drug dosing regimens.,"The aim of this article is to review current knowledge about the clinical impact of patients' variable adherence to prescribed anti-infective drug dosing regimens, with the aim of renewing interest and exploration of this important but largely neglected area of therapeutics. Central to the estimation of a patient's adherence to a prescribed drug regimen is a reliably compiled drug dosing history. Electronic monitoring methods have emerged as the virtual 'gold standard' for compiling drug dosing histories in ambulatory patients. Reliably compiled drug dosing histories are consistently downwardly skewed, with varying degrees of under-dosing. In particular, the consideration of time intervals between protease inhibitor doses has revealed that ambulatory patients' variable execution of prescribed dosing regimens is a leading source of variance in viral response. Such analyses reveal the need for a new discipline, called pharmionics, which is the study of how ambulatory patients use prescription drugs. Properly analysed, reliable data on the time-course of patients' actual intake of prescription drugs can eliminate a major source of unallocated variance in drug responses, including the non-response that occurs and is easily misinterpreted when a patient's complete non-execution of a prescribed drug regimen is unrecognized clinically. As such, reliable compilation of ambulatory patients' drug dosing histories has the promise of being a key step in reducing unallocated variance in drug response and in improving the informational yield of clinical trials. It is also the basis for sound, measurement-guided steps taken to improve a patient's execution of a prescribed dosing regimen."
15794714,Adverse effects of antiretroviral therapy for HIV infection: a review of selected topics.,"In the current era of HIV treatment, the toxicity profiles of antiretroviral drugs have increasingly emerged as a basis for selecting initial antiretroviral regimens as well as a reason for switching therapy in treatment-experienced patients. In this respect, an intensive research effort involving clinical research as well as basic science research over the past six years, has focused on the cluster of metabolic and body composition abnormalities that have come to be termed the 'lipodystrophy syndrome'. These data have now provided a clear and clinically relevant understanding of the individual profiles of drugs within the nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor , HIV protease inhibitor and non-nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor drug classes, and have provided a rational basis for assessing and monitoring these adverse effects in clinical practice. In this review, current and emerging drug toxicities are considered with an emphasis on lipodystrophy complications."
15807857,Persistently high IgA serum levels are a marker of immunological or virological failure of combined antiretroviral therapy in children with perinatal HIV-1 infection.,"Non-expensive and low-complexity surrogate markers for monitoring the response to combined antiretroviral therapy (combined-ART) are needed in poor-resource settings where routine assessment of CD4+ T-lymphocyte count and viral load can not be afforded. We longitudinally evaluated Ig serum levels in 234 HIV-1 infected children receiving combined-ART with > or = 3 drugs. Since Ig levels physiologically vary with age, differences at different age periods were evaluated as differences in z-scores calculated using the mean and standard deviation of the normal population for each age period. Data from 17 (7.3%) children with immunological failure and from 54 (23.1%) children with virological failure of combined-ART were compared with data from not-failed children. At baseline children with immunological failure showed higher IgM z-scores (P = 0.042) than children without. After 3-12 months of therapy immunologically failed children displayed higher viral loads (P < 0.0001) and IgA (P = 0.043) z-scores than not-failed children. Similarly, at the same follow-up time, children with virological failure showed lower CD4(+) T-lymphocyte percentages (P = 0.005) and higher IgA z-scores (P < 0.0001) than not-failed children. No difference in IgG or IgM z-scores was evidenced between failed and not-failed children after 3-12 months of therapy. In conclusion, IgA serum level is a cheap and low-complexity marker of immunological or virological failure of combined-ART which might be adopted in poor-resource settings."
15807942,The use of therapeutic drug monitoring in the management of protease inhibitor-related toxicity.,"The aim of this project was to determine whether therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) and subsequent dose modification is effective in the management of protease inhibitor (PI)-associated toxicity. A retrospective case-notes review of patients who had had TDM for suspected antiretroviral drug toxicity from November 2000 to March 2002 was carried out. This identified six symptomatic patients in whom high plasma drug levels of a PI had been found and subsequent dose modification was associated with improvement/resolution of symptoms. In 5/6 patients viral loads were below the level of detection prior to TDM and remained so after dose reduction of PI. TDM-directed dose modification of PI enables patients to continue effective regimens of highly active antiretroviral therapy, thus avoiding the need to switch the regimen."
15812617,Use of electronic monitoring devices to measure antiretroviral adherence: practical considerations.,"The purpose of this paper is to describe electronic monitoring device (EMD) (e.g., MEMS caps) use among HIV-infected adults enrolled in a randomized clinical trial and to make explicit some of the benefits and caveats of using electronic monitoring device technology. This is a descriptive, exploratory study of EMD use among 128 HIV-infected adults treated with at least three antiretroviral agents. Thirty-six percent of the sample admitted that they did not use the EMD consistently. Forty-one percent of the subjects reported taking out more than one dose at a time and 26% reported opening the EMD but not taking the medication. Special subject-related issues accounted for only a small percentage of all reported problems with EMD use (e.g., transient housing, incarceration, substance abuse relapse and drug treatment). Results of this study suggest that EMDs may underestimate antiretroviral adherence among HIV-infected adults. Recommendations for improving EMD data quality are presented."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictivity of the GIQ in 116 protease inhibitor-experienced patients treated with lopinavir-ritonavir. The overall decrease in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA from baseline to month 6 was a median of -1.50 log(10) copies/ml and 40% of patients had plasma HIV-1 RNA below 400 copies/ml at month 6. The overall median lopinavir study-state C(min) concentration was 5,856 ng/ml. Using univariate linear regression analyses, both lopinavir GIQ and the number of baseline lopinavir mutations were highly associated with virologic response through 6 months. In the multivariate analysis, only lopinavir GIQ, baseline HIV RNA, and the number of prior protease inhibitors were significantly associated with response. When the analysis was limited to patients with more highly mutant viruses (three or more lopinavir mutations), only lopinavir GIQ remained significantly associated with virologic response. This study suggests that GIQ could be a better predictor of the virologic response than virological (genotype) or pharmacological (minimal plasma concentration) approaches used separately, especially among patients with at least three protease inhibitor resistance mutations. Therapeutic drug monitoring for patients treated by lopinavir-ritonavir would likely be most useful in patients with substantially resistant viruses."

15910009,Application and impact of population pharmacokinetics in the assessment of antiretroviral pharmacotherapy.,"Population pharmacokinetics has been an important technique used to explore and define relevant sources of variation in drug exposure and response in patient populations. This has been especially true in the area of antiretroviral therapy where the assurance of adequate and sustained drug exposure of multiple agents is highly correlated with therapeutic success. Population pharmacokinetic analyses across the four drug classes and 20 US FDA-approved products used to treat HIV have been published to date. The published reports were predominantly based on actual clinical trials conducted in HIV-infected patients with one or more agents administered. Modelling and simulation approaches have been used in the evaluation of antiretroviral agent outcomes incorporating problematic design and analysis factors such as sparse plasma sampling, data imbalance and censored data. Additional benefits of population modelling approaches applied to the investigation of antiretroviral agents include the ability to assess dosing compliance, understanding and quantifying drug-drug interactions in order to select dosing regimens and the screening of new drug candidates. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models have been used to characterise the relationship between drug exposure and virological and immunological response, and to predict clinical outcome. These models offer the best opportunity for individualising and optimising patient therapy, particularly when adjusted for adherence/compliance. The impact of population pharmacokinetics in the area of antiretroviral therapy can be directly assessed by its role in the validation of surrogate markers such as viral RNA load, therapeutic drug monitoring and the management of individual patient outcomes via exposure-toxicity relationships. Each of these population pharmacokinetic outcomes has contributed to the current regulatory environment, specifically in the area of accelerated approval of new antiretroviral agents."

However, the utility of TDM is considered to be on an individual basis until more data are obtained from large clinical trials showing the benefit of TDM. In April 2004, a panel of experts met in Rome, Italy. This followed an inaugural meeting in Perugia, Italy, in October 2000, which resulted in the article published in AIDS 2002, 16(Suppl 1):S5-S37. The objectives of this second meeting were to review the questions surrounding TDM of antiretroviral drugs and discuss the clinical utility, current concerns and future prospects of drug concentration monitoring in the care of HIV-1-infected individuals. This report, which has been updated to include material published or presented at international conferences up to the end of September 2004, reviews pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data and reports the issues discussed by the panel, offering advice to clinical care providers who may be currently, or are considering incorporating TDM into the routine care of their patients.

A simple high-performance liquid chromatographic method using UV detection was developed and validated for the analysis of atazanavir in human plasma. The sample clean up was carried out using solid-phase extraction with OASIS MCX cartridge. The chromatographic separation was achieved on a Kromasil C18 (150 mm x 3 mm, 5 microm) column with a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile and water (38:62 v/v) delivered isocratically. The effluent of the column was monitored at a wavelength of 210 nm. The assay was linear over the concentration range of 0.156 to 10 microg/ml and the limit of quantification was 0.156 microg/ml. The method was also validated with respect to recovery, precision, accuracy and specificity. This method is suitable for therapeutic drug monitoring of atazanavir and can be easily reproduced with standard equipment."
15930890,No pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction between nevirapine and paclitaxel.,"We have investigated the pharmacokinetics of nevirapine and paclitaxel in a patient who used both drugs concomitantly, as there are strong theoretical indications for a potential pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction. Plasma concentrations of nevirapine (dose: 200 mg twice daily orally) and paclitaxel (dose: 100 mg/m(2) 3-h i.v. infusion) were determined in a HIV-1-infected patient with Kaposi's sarcoma. Since both drugs are metabolized via the same cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, investigation of a drug-drug interaction was considered important. We found that the plasma concentrations of nevirapine given together with paclitaxel were similar to those given without paclitaxel. The exposures to paclitaxel (AUC(0-infinity) = 3787 h.ng/ml) and its hydroxy metabolites when co-administered with nevirapine were comparable to the mean exposure to paclitaxel and its metabolites from eight historical controls (AUC(0-infinity) = 3614 h.ng/ml) treated with the same dose. No pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction between nevirapine and paclitaxel could be demonstrated in our HIV-1-infected patient."
15969776,A drug dosage table is a useful tool to facilitate prescriptions of antiretroviral drugs for children in Thailand.,"Scaling up of antiretroviral treatment (ART) for children in countries like Thailand will require decentralization and management by non-specialist doctors. We describe (a) the formulation of a standardized drug dosage table to facilitate antiretroviral drug (ARV) prescriptions for children, (b) the acceptability of such a table among doctors and (c) the safety and efficacy of drug doses in the table. Acceptability was assessed using a questionnaire. Safety and efficacy were assessed on the basis of incidence of adverse effects and virological response to treatment, respectively. Of all doctors (n=18), 17 (94%) found that the table was practical to use, avoided miscalculations and made them more confident with prescriptions. Of 49 children prescribed ARVs, less than 5% had adverse side-effects. All ARV-naive children achieved undetectable viral loads within six months of ART. In our setting, a standardized drug dosage table provided a simple and reliable tool that facilitated ARV prescriptions for children."
15980618,FHD: an index to evaluate drug elimination by hemodialysis.,"BACKGROUND: In hemodialyzed patients, physicians have to (1) adjust drug dosage for a creatinine clearance lower than 10-15 ml/min and (2) know whether or not the drug will be removed by the dialysis session to decide whether it may be administered before or after the session on dialysis days. However, of several indices being used to evaluate drug removal by dialysis none is appropriate and we suggest a novel index named F(HD), which reflects the role of hemodialysis clearance of a drug in its overall clearance during the session. METHODS: Pharmacokinetic simulations were performed to test the influence of dialysis on the pharmacokinetics of some drugs, whether F(HD) was considered or not, to determine when to administer the drug. F(HD) was then calculated for several drugs and its value compared with other indices. Five hemodialysis patients from our department for whom the time of drug administration was determined according to F(HD) were included in a small study and their drugs' trough concentrations were monitored. RESULTS: F(HD) emphasized that considering hemodialysis clearance alone may lead to false interpretations of the potential dialyzability of some drugs. In our patients, who received their treatment according to the 'F(HD) rule', monitoring of trough levels gave satisfactory results. CONCLUSION: The use of the 'F(HD) rule' should be tested on a long-term administration basis to confirm our conclusion. F(HD )could be the index of choice to determine when to administer a drug, before or after the session, in hemodialysis patients."
15983027,Impact of rosiglitazone treatment on the bioavailability of antiretroviral compounds in HIV-positive patients.,"OBJECTIVES: The insulin-sensitizer rosiglitazone is under investigation for therapy of HIV-associated lipodystrophy syndrome (LDS). Little is known about pharmacological interactions with antiretroviral (ARV) drugs. METHODS: Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of ARV drugs was performed in a prospective study before and at day 28 after start of treatment with 4 mg of rosiglitazone for combined LDS. Drug levels were measured in the morning fasting, and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h after standardized drug intake. Values were log-transformed for analysis. RESULTS: Twelve males and six females were assessed; mean age was 50.7 years and mean CD4 cell count was 496 cells/mm(3). All patients had a viral load below 50 copies/mL, and backbone ARV therapy consisted of two or three nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors in all cases. After administration of rosiglitazone, no significant differences in Cmax, Cmin and AUC were found in cases treated with efavirenz (n = 10) and lopinavir (n = 4). Mean Cmax of nevirapine (n = 4) was reduced significantly [-0.44; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.86 to -0.01]. Furthermore, there was a consistent trend to a reduction in the geometric mean ratio (GMR) of Cmax, Cmin and AUC (GMR of Cmax 0.95; 95% CI 0.9-1.0; GMR of Cmin 0.89; 95% CI 0.65-1.13; GMR of AUC 0.96; 95% CI 0.91-1.01). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with 4 mg of rosiglitazone for HIV-associated LDS is likely to reduce the bioavailability of nevirapine. Thus, routine TDM is recommended for patients treated with rosiglitazone and nevirapine. A therapy consisting of efavirenz or lopinavir seems to be without negative impact. Further studies on the interaction of rosiglitazone with ARV drugs are necessary."

16010160,Early monitoring of ribavirin plasma concentrations may predict anemia and early virologic response in HIV/hepatitis C virus-coinfected patients.,"Ribavirin (RBV) in combination with pegylated interferon alpha (pegIFN) is currently the standard treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The development of anemia requires a reduction in RBV doses in a substantial proportion of patients, limiting their chances of treatment response. The primary goal of this study was to assess if early monitoring of RBV plasma levels could help to predict anemia as well as early HCV RNA response in HIV/HCV-coinfected individuals. The secondary goal was to evaluate if antiretroviral drugs might influence RBV plasma levels. Plasma RBV concentrations were measured at weeks 4 and 12 in 98 HIV/HCV-coinfected individuals who initiated therapy with pegIFN-2a (180 microg/wk) plus RBV (800-1200 mg/d). RBV plasma levels correlated with RBV dose per kilogram of body weight (P = 0.02). Larger drops in hemoglobin levels were independently associated with higher RBV plasma levels and zidovudine (ZDV) use (P < 0.001). Likewise, higher RBV levels (P = 0.007) and HCV genotype 3 (P < 0.001) were found to be independent predictors of virologic response at week 4. Similar findings were obtained at week 12. Patients receiving ZDV concomitantly showed significantly higher RBV plasma concentrations compared with those who did not (3.28 mug/mL vs. 2.51 mug/mL; P = 0.002). RBV levels were not significantly altered by the coadministration of other nucleoside/nucleotide analogues. In summary, RBV plasma levels correlate with the development of anemia and with the achievement of an early virologic response. Therefore, early therapeutic drug monitoring might help to tailor RBV dosages, improving the efficacy and safety of anti-HCV treatment."

The objectives of this second meeting were to review and update the numerous questions surrounding TDM of antiretroviral drugs and discuss the clinical utility, current concerns and future prospects of drug concentration monitoring in the care of HIV-1-infected individuals. A major focus of the meeting was to discuss and critically analyse recent and precedent clinical drug-drug interaction data to provide a clear framework of the pharmacological basis of how one drug may impact the disposition of another. This report, which has been updated to include material published or presented at international conferences up to the end of December 2004, reviews recent pivotal pharmacokinetic interaction data and provides advice to clinical care providers on how some drug-drug interactions may be prevented, avoided or managed, and, when data are available, on what dose adjustments and interventions should be performed."
16044006,Therapeutic drug monitoring of efavirenz: trough levels cannot be estimated on the basis of earlier plasma determinations.,"OBJECTIVE: The few studies evaluating the relation between efavirenz (EFV) plasma levels and efficacy have only shown a weak association. They are based on population pharmacokinetics and/or estimation of trough levels from samples obtained at different time points, because this drug is usually taken at bedtime. We explore whether a limited sampling strategy could provide a good estimation of EFV trough levels and area under the curve (AUC). METHODS: Fifty-nine 24-hour profiles from patients on 600 mg of EFV administered once daily were included for the analysis. Plasma drug concentrations were determined by a validated high-performance liquid chromatography assay. The relation between EFV plasma concentrations at C8, C12, and C16 and the corresponding C24 and AUC0-24 values were assessed in different index sets, and their predictive performances were evaluated in the validation sets. RESULTS: EFV plasma levels at C12 and C16 are precise predictors of AUC0-24 (<or=10% mean relative prediction errors). The estimation of C24 levels from EFV plasma concentrations at C8, C12, or C16 is not precise enough (18%-62% mean relative prediction errors), however, and the use of C12 and C16 in combination does not improve the accuracy of C24 prediction. CONCLUSION: No adequate substitute for collecting blood 24 hours after dosing emerged from this analysis, which might explain the weak association observed between EFV plasma levels and treatment outcomes in the studies available."
16044095,TDM: therapeutic drug measuring or therapeutic drug monitoring?,"The third round of the International Interlaboratory Quality Control Program for Therapeutic Drug Monitoring in HIV infection (QC-program) consisted of the analysis not only of plasma samples but also of patient cases. The case was composed of different topics related to the therapeutic drug monitoring of antiretroviral drugs. The participants were asked to give recommendations concerning dose adjustments, changes to the regimen, and drug-drug interactions to observe whether the expert recommendations were comparable. Of the 30 participants of the QC-program, 16 returned their comments and recommendations with regard to the patient case. The drug level was easy to judge: approximately 90% were able to correctly do so. Almost half of the recommendations (44%) given were satisfactory. Levels of knowledge regarding HIV treatment appeared to be variable among the respondents and for this reason were partly incomparable."
16044111,Determination of nevirapine and efavirenz in plasma using GC/MS in selected ion monitoring mode.,"An accurate, selective, and sensitive method for the determination of the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) nevirapine (nvp) and efavirenz (efv) in human plasma using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy in selected ion monitoring mode (GC/MS-SIM) was developed. Solid-phase extraction (SPE) gave extraction yields near 100% for both nvp and efv, and calibration curves were linear over the therapeutic concentration ranges. Variation of intraday and interday precision was below 5%. Intraday and interday inaccuracies varied between 0.6% and 10.4%. The lower limits of detection using a 200-microL plasma sample were 27 ng/mL for nvp and 26 ng/mL for efv, and the lower limits of quantification were 54 ng/mL and 72 ng/mL, respectively. The method was applied to the determination of nvp and efv in plasma specimens of 73 patients in HIV stage III or IV and on antiretroviral treatment in Kigali, Rwanda."
16091250,Therapeutic drug monitoring: pharmacologic considerations for antiretroviral drugs.,"Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is the process by which a patient's dosing regimen is guided by repeated measures of plasma drug concentrations. An enormous challenge with regard to TDM of antiretroviral drugs (ARV) is that the concentration goals can be moving targets. Well-designed prospective studies demonstrating that prospectively altering ARV doses based on TDM leads to virologic success and increased tolerability are needed. Nevertheless, there are specific clinical instances where this experimental intervention should be considered to potentially reduce toxicity and improve therapeutic outcomes."
16120068,Therapeutic drug monitoring of atazanavir: surveillance of pharmacotherapy in the clinic.,"BACKGROUND: Therapeutic failure with antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a substantial issue where viral rebound, viral resistance and drug-related toxicity remain serious concerns. Drug exposure-response relationships have been described for the protease inhibitors, pharmacokinetic variability is substantial for this class of drugs and drug interactions can also alter ART exposure. Given this background we established a therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) service to monitor atazanavir (ATV) plasma concentrations early after the therapy was made available to treatment-experienced people infected with HIV who were managed in a clinical setting. METHODS: This was a prospective observational study which evaluated plasma samples from 110 highly treatment-experienced people with HIV using TDM and applied pharmacokinetic analysis over a five month period. RESULTS: ATV trough concentrations exhibited substantial intersubject variability (<25-2108 microg l(-1)). A substantial number of subjects (50%,13/26) who received ATV400 mg daily had low exposure to ATV. Serum bilirubin concentrations correlated significantly with higher ATV trough concentrations (rho = 0.803; P < 0.001) and 55% (29/53) of subjects who received ATV300/100 mg RTV daily had plasma concentrations above a proposed target concentration associated with elevated bilirubin concentrations. This study confirmed low ATV exposure in eight subjects with HIV receiving ATV 400 mg daily. Reasons for low ATV exposure in this cohort include administration of interacting drugs, including a possible interaction with ritonavir, fluticasone and ATV, impaired ATV absorption secondary to suspected achlorhydria and potential interactions with colchicine and nandrolone. Viral load remained undetectable in most of these subjects with low ATV exposure. CONCLUSIONS: TDM and targeted pharmacokinetic studies should be viewed as fundamental tools in the development and clinical application of ART, to improve pharmacotherapy for people with HIV."

16156885,Clinical benefit of interventions driven by therapeutic drug monitoring.,"BACKGROUND: Adequate plasma concentrations of antiretroviral drugs are key to achieving and maintaining long-term suppression of HIV replication. Multiple factors may influence drug levels, causing increases or reductions that may, respectively, result in toxicity or virological failure. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) might help to detect and correct such abnormalities. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the usefulness of TDM in the care of HIV-infected patients in an out-patient clinical setting. METHOD: S All the requests for TDM of protease inhibitors (PIs) and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) for patients attending our HIV out-patient clinic from October 2000 to August 2003 were analysed. Blood samples were collected before the morning dose. Drug concentrations were measured by high performance liquid chromatography by ultraviolet waves (HPLC-UV). R:A total of 151 requests from 137 patients were assessed. The reasons for requesting TDM were drug toxicity (59%), virological failure (39%) and possible drug interactions (2%). NNRTI levels were more often requested because of toxicity, while PI levels were more often requested because of virological failure. Elevated drug levels were confirmed in 36% of patients with suspected drug toxicity, while subtherapeutic levels were found in 37% of patients failing virologically. Based on the results of TDM, dose modifications were made in 37% of patients, allowing correction of such abnormalities in 80% of cases. Moreover, adequate plasma concentrations were confirmed in 79% of patients whose levels were assessed again. CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic drug monitoring may be a useful tool to identify toxic levels of NNRTI and subtherapeutic concentrations of PI. Dose adjustments following TDM may ameliorate drug-related toxicities or improve virological response rates."
16175128,Limited sampling strategy for the estimation of systemic exposure to the protease inhibitor nelfinavir.,"Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of antiretroviral drugs has been proposed as a means of optimizing response to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in HIV infection because suboptimal exposure to these agents may lead to the development of resistant viral strains and subsequent therapeutic failure. The area under the curve (AUC), though considered to make the best estimate of total drug exposure, requires repeated blood sampling. The authors investigated the predictability of individual nelfinavir (NFV) concentrations at different time points for the AUC and tried to find the best sampling time for the abbreviated AUC to predict NFV total body exposure. A total of 99 NFV AUC0-12h values were measured in 99 patients receiving a 1250-mg oral dose twice a day. Venous blood samples were collected at baseline (predose, 0) and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 12 hours postdose. A stepwise forward-selection, multiple-regression technique was chosen to assess the relative importance of single and combination concentration time points to predict the AUC calculated from the entire pharmacokinetic profile. Data were split into a development set and a validation set. The development set contained 49 randomly selected HIV patients. Of these, 22 HIV patients were coinfected with HCV, 7 with and 15 without cirrhosis. One-point predictors provided the lowest prediction precision, but predictive performance improved after the first 2 hours postdose. Plasma concentrations at 0 and 4 hours after the oral dose were most predictive if 2 variables were used in the regression equation. The AUC could be estimated from data for these 2 samples by using the following equation: AUC0-12 = 3.0 + 2.7 (C0) + 6.4 (C4), r = 92. The predictive performance of 2-point predictors at 0 and 4 hours (C0 + C4) was validated by comparing their ability to predict the full AUC in a validation set representative of HIV/HCV patients (n = 28) and HIV/HCV patients, with (n = 8) and without (n = 14) cirrhosis. The results showed a mean bias ranging from +2.7% in HIV/HCV patients to -6.0% in HCV coinfection with cirrhosis. The authors conclude that this result is clinically significant. The limited sampling strategy (LSS) described could be used in clinical practice for the easy assessment of the total exposure to NFV in HIV/HCV patients, both with and without cirrhosis."
16176117,Clinical pharmacokinetics and summary of efficacy and tolerability of atazanavir.,"The efficacy of HIV-1 protease inhibitors (PIs) as part of highly active antiretroviral therapy is now well established and has provided benefits to many patients with HIV infection. Atazanavir is a new azapeptide PI compound that was recently approved in the US and Europe. Atazanavir is recommended in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. Atazanavir is rapidly absorbed and administration of a single dose of atazanavir with a light meal resulted in a 70% increase in area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC); therefore atazanavir should be taken with food. Atazanavir is 86% bound to human serum protein independently of concentration. Concentration in body fluids appeared to be lower than plasma concentration. Like other PIs, atazanavir is extensively metabolised by hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A isoenzymes. The mean terminal elimination half-life in healthy volunteers was approximately 7 hours at steady state following administration of atazanavir 400 mg daily with a light meal. When atazanavir 300 mg was coadministered with ritonavir 100 mg on a once-daily dosage regimen, atazanavir AUC from 0 to 24 hours and minimum plasma concentration were increased by 3- to 4-fold and approximately 10-fold, respectively, compared with atazanavir 300 mg alone. Therefore, ritonavir boosted atazanavir regimen (ritonavir 100 mg and atazanavir 300 mg once daily) is increasingly favoured in some patients. Efavirenz, a potent CYP3A inducer, decreased atazanavir concentrations by 75% and, unexpectedly, tenofovir, a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor, decreased atazanavir concentrations by 25%. Average predose concentrations in HIV-infected patients who received atazanavir 400mg once daily were 273 ng/mL, which was believed to be several-fold higher than protein-binding corrected 50% inhibitory concentration of wild-type viruses. In HIV-infected patients who received once-daily ritonavir (100mg) boosted atazanavir (300 mg), mean (+/-SD) trough concentration was 862 (+/-838) ng/mL. Several clinical trials showed the efficacy of atazanavir 400 mg once daily with a nucleoside analogue backbone in antiretroviral-naive patients. The atazanavir 300/ritonavir 100 mg once-daily combination coadministered with other antiretrovirals showed the efficacy of this strategy in patients receiving efavirenz or in moderately antiretroviral-experienced HIV-infected patients. Recommended once-daily doses of atazanavir taken with food are either 400 mg or 300 mg in combination with low dose ritonavir (100 mg) in moderately antiretroviral-experienced patients. Major advantages of atazanavir to date are its simplicity of administration (once-daily administration) and its less undesirable effect on the lipid profiles in patients."
16182761,Role of therapeutic drug monitoring in a patient with human immunodeficiency virus infection and end-stage liver disease undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation.,"Pharmacological interactions between protease inhibitors and tacrolimus require careful monitoring to prevent toxicity in the posttransplantation period. A 42-year-old man with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and end-stage liver disease due to hepatitis C virus (HCV) received an orthotopic liver transplant. At the time of surgery the patient was on triple antiretroviral therapy (tenofovir, lamivudine, and lopinavir/ritonavir) with a stable CD4(+) count (>500 cells/mm(3)) and HIV-1 RNA (<50 copies/mL). Immunosuppression was maintained with tacrolimus (0.5 mg at a single dose once per week). One month after surgery HCV recurrence was documented. Pharmacokinetic evaluation of lopinavir/ritonavir showed a rapid increase in the area under the curve. Drug concentrations returned to normal levels, with reduction in liver enzymes. At the same time, tacrolimus dosages were reduced to a maintenance dose of 0.5 mg every 2 weeks. The patient, at 17 months postoperatively, is alive in good health with normal liver function and HCV RNA load levels. This is the first case in which a profound change in the pharmacokinetics of a protease inhibitor caused by a drug-drug interaction was observed during transient liver damage. Because this clinical event is particularly common in HIV-infected patients, our findings suggest that therapeutic drug monitoring should be performed to determine the impact of potential drug interactions in the early posttransplantation period, at the time of resumption of therapy or introduction of new anti-retroviral therapy and during HCV recurrence in order to optimize both tacrolimus and protease inhibitor treatment."
16193530,Quantification of antiretroviral drugs in dried blood spot samples by means of liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry.,"For the first time approved antiretroviral drugs, i.e. protease inhibitors (PI) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI), were quantified in dried blood spots (DBS) from HIV/AIDS patient whole blood samples as the basis for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) by a robust simultaneous liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method. This study included seven PI (amprenavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, lopinavir, saquinavir, ritonavir, atazanavir) and two NNRTI (nevirapine, efavirenz). LC/MS/MS coupling was realized using a Phenomenex Synergy Max RP LC column (150 x 2 mm, 4 micro) in combination with a tandem mass spectrometer (API 2000, Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex Concord) operating in positive and negative multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode with reserpine as internal standard. DBS samples were punched out and extracted with 50:50 MeOH/0.2 M ZnSO4 (v/v) as extraction reagent. The method performance data for the drugs in DBS like limits of detection (LOD, 8-70 ng/mL), lower limits of quantification (LLOQ, 41-102 ng/mL), linearity (R2, 0.9981-0.9999), linear concentration ranges (41-10.000 ng/mL), accuracies (92-113%), recoveries (62-94%), and ion suppression were investigated and are comparable to data obtained from human plasma, which is the current standard matrix for TDM of PI and NNRTI. In this case, off-line plasma sample preparation was performed by means of simple protein precipitation with 80:20 methanol/0.2 M ZnSO4 (v/v) as precipitation reagent. Significant correlations between real patient plasma and DBS were obtained for samples containing lopinavir, atazanavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, and efavirenz. DBS preparation as sampling alternative is well suited and practicable for TDM minimizing the high infection risk of HIV/AIDS samples and may facilitate sample mailing."
16267739,"Prediction of neuropsychiatric adverse events associated with long-term efavirenz therapy, using plasma drug level monitoring.","BACKGROUND: Data on long-term central nervous system (CNS) toxicity associated with efavirenz therapy are scarce, and risk factors remain largely unknown. We aimed to determine whether monitoring the plasma concentration of efavirenz could predict neuropsychiatric adverse events associated with long-term therapy with efavirenz. METHODS: We performed a longitudinal study involving 17 consecutive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected subjects with virological suppression after at least 6 months of antiretroviral therapy with an efavirenz-containing regimen. Efavirenz plasma concentrations were measured at study entry and at different time points through an 18-month study period. RESULTS: Median duration of efavirenz therapy before study entry was 18 months (range, 6-27 months). Ten (58.8%) of the patients experienced CNS-related adverse effects, ranging from insomnia and abnormal dreams to depression with suicidal ideation. In 4 (23.5%) of the cases, CNS toxicity led to efavirenz discontinuation. Mean (+/- standard deviation) plasma levels were higher for patients experiencing neuropsychiatric symptoms (5.10 +/- 2.15 microg/mL vs. 2.79 +/- 1.31 microg/mL; P = .024). A plasma level of 2.74 microg/mL had a sensitivity of 90.9% and specificity of 72% to predict CNS toxicity (area under the curve, 0.839; 95% confidence interval, 0.73-0.95; P < .0001). Patients having efavirenz plasma concentrations > 2.74 microg/mL at any time point of the study were 5.68 times more likely to experiencing CNS toxicity than were other patients (95% confidence interval, 1.97-16.37). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with HIV infection receiving long-term therapy with efavirenz-containing antiretroviral regimens, CNS toxicity is related to efavirenz plasma levels. Patients achieving higher plasma levels are at increased risk of experiencing neuropsychiatric adverse events."
16313293,Depletion of mitochondrial DNA copies/cell in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in HIV-1-infected treatment-naive patients.,"OBJECTIVES: Mitochondrial toxicity is believed to be the main reason for adverse effects related to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). The aim of the present study was to compare mitochondrial toxicity in NRTI-treated HIV-positive patients, HIV-positive treatment-naive patients and HIV-negative controls by comparing mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copies/cell in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and lactate/pyruvate (L/P) ratios in the different groups. METHODS: We enrolled 60 participants in the study: 31 patients on combined antiretroviral therapy (CART), 14 HIV-positive treatment-naive patients and 15 HIV-negative controls. mtDNA (copies/cell) in peripheral blood was analysed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Standard curves and serial dilutions of plasmid-cloned mitochondrion and retinoblastoma (RB1) PCR products with known concentrations were generated to estimate the mtDNA and nuclear DNA (nDNA) copy numbers in each sample. The L/P ratio was enzymatically and spectrophotometrically analysed in samples from individuals in a fasted, non-exercise state. Results The median mtDNA copy number was 63 copies/cell (interquartile range 33-94) in HIV-positive patients and 153 (132-283) in HIV-negative controls (P<0.001). No significant difference was seen between the HIV-positive NRTI-exposed patients and the HIV-positive treatment-naive patients. Current use of didanosine was negatively correlated with depletion of mtDNA (r=-0.36, P=0.046). HIV-positive patients also had a higher L/P ratio compared with HIV-negative controls (P=0.004). CONCLUSIONS: The number of mtDNA copies/cell in PBMCs was depleted in HIV-positive treatment-naive patients as well as in HIV-positive NRTI-exposed patients. HIV-positive patients also had a higher L/P ratio compared with HIV-negative controls, which supports this conclusion. The study suggests that neither mtDNA in PBMCs nor L/P ratio is a good marker of NRTI-associated mitochondrial toxicity."
16373004,Therapeutic drug monitoring and the inhibitory quotient of antiretroviral drugs: can they be applied to the current situation?,"Therapeutic drug monitoring is attracting growing interest as a means of increasing the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy and of decreasing its toxicity, although data supporting this strategy are still scarce. Currently, nucleoside analog reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NARTI) are not candidates because their effect depends on their active intracellular form and not on plasma concentration. Protease inhibitors (PI) and non-nucleoside analogue reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNARTI) meet the criteria for therapeutic drug monitoring. The main limitations are that the parameters to be monitored in order to measure exposure to the drug and the effective concentration of the drug have not been well defined. The few studies performed in treatment-naive patients have demonstrated that monitoring improves therapeutic efficacy. This strategy will be particularly useful when the risk of subtherapeutic or toxic concentrations is especially high (pharmacokinetic interactions, intestinal malabsorption, adverse effects, virological failure without obvious cause, pregnancy, children). Although it remains to be standardized, the inhibitory quotient integrates pharmacological and virological parameters and is useful in patients with prior virological failure. Any therapeutic drug monitoring program should be accompanied by measures to monitor and improve treatment adherence. There are good reasons to believe that therapeutic drug monitoring can be useful to improve treatment in specific circumstances. However, before its widespread use as a routine method can be recommended, the parameters to be used should be standardized and studies with appropriate methodology should be performed to define the role of therapeutic drug monitoring in distinct clinical situations."
16375615,"Pillboxes and antiretroviral adherence: prevalence of use, perceived benefits, and implications for electronic medication monitoring devices.","HIV treatment adherence is improved by behavioral interventions, including medication organizers such as pillboxes, which can also interfere with adherence electronic monitoring devices (EMD). This study examined the characteristics of pillbox users and the implications of pillbox use for research using EMD adherence research. Men and women (n = 160) currently taking antiretroviral medications (ARVs) completed anonymous surveys in a community research setting. Sixty-three (39%) of individuals taking ARVs were currently using a pillbox. Pillbox users were significantly more likely to have an undetectable viral load and less likely to have missed their medications within a day of the assessment. Pillbox users indicated feeling that they benefited from using their pillbox and 76% reported they would likely stop using their pillbox if required to participate in a research study that paid them. Adherence EMD pose methodological limitations to research when pillbox users are excluded and ethical implications when pillbox users stop using their pillbox to participate."
16377535,A new model to monitor the virological efficacy of antiretroviral treatment in resource-poor countries.,"Monitoring the efficacy of antiretroviral treatment in developing countries is difficult because these countries have few laboratory facilities to test viral load and drug resistance. Those that exist are faced with a shortage of trained staff, unreliable electricity supply, and costly reagents. Not only that, but most HIV patients in resource-poor countries do not have access to such testing. We propose a new model for monitoring antiretroviral treatment in resource-limited settings that uses patients' clinical and treatment history, adherence to treatment, and laboratory indices such as haemoglobin level and total lymphocyte count to identify virological treatment failure, and offers patients future treatment options. We believe that this model can make an accurate diagnosis of treatment failure in most patients. However, operational research is needed to assess whether this strategy works in practice."
16406832,Simultaneous determination of 16 anti-HIV drugs in human plasma by high-performance liquid chromatography.,"Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is pivotal to improve the management of HIV infection. Here, a HPLC-UV method has been developed to quantify simultaneously seven HIV protease inhibitors (amprenavir, atazanavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, and saquinavir; PIs), seven nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (abacavir, didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, stavudine, zalcitabine, and zidovudine; NRTIs), and two non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (efavirenz and nevirapine; NNRTIs) in human plasma. The volume of the plasma sample was 600 microL. This method involved automated solid-phase extraction with Oasis HLB Cartridge 1 cc (divinylbenzene and N-vinylpyrrolidone) and evaporation in a water bath under nitrogen stream. The extracted samples were reconstituted with 100 microL methanol. Twenty microliters of these samples were injected into a HPLC-UV system, the analytes were eluted on an analytical C(18) Symmetry column (250 mm x 4.6mm I.D.) with a particle size of 5 microm. The mobile phase (0.01 M KH(2)PO(4) and acetonitrile) was delivered at 1.0 mL/min with linear gradient elution. The total run time for a single analysis was 35 min, the anti-HIV drugs were detected by UV at 240 and 260 nm. The calibration curves were linear up to 10 microg/mL. The absolute recovery ranged between 88 and 120%. The in vitro stability of anti-HIV drugs (0.005-10 microg/mL) in plasma has been studied at 24.0 degrees C. On these bases, a two to four analyte method has been tailored to the individual needs of the HIV-infected patient. The HPLC-UV method here reported has been validated and is currently applied to monitor PIs, NRTIs, and NNRTIs in plasma of HIV-infected patients. It allows to monitor the largest number of anti-HIV drugs simultaneously, appearing useful in a routine laboratory, and represents an essential step to elucidate the utility of a formal therapeutic drug monitoring for the optimal follow-up of HIV-infected patients."
16418700,Determination of amprenavir total and unbound concentrations in plasma by high-performance liquid chromatography and ultrafiltration.,"Amprenavir is an HIV-1 protease inhibitor with high protein binding (90%) in human plasma. This study was designed to develop an assay to measure the concentration of unbound amprenavir, to study variation with time in patients, and to investigate whether ritonavir and lopinavir, other protease inhibitors that could be combined, interact with amprenavir protein binding in vitro. A reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography assay to UV detection was developed and validated to measure total amprenavir in plasma, and this method was adapted to quantitate low concentrations of unbound amprenavir in ultrafiltrate aqueous fluid. Equilibrium dialysis and ultrafiltration were used and compared with separate unbound fraction. The latter method was easier to use and was, therefore, subsequently adopted. In 10 patients who received amprenavir 600 mg bid combined with ritonavir, mean amprenavir free-fraction in plasma was 8.6% (range, 4.4-20%). When added to pooled human plasmas at concentrations close to those found in treated patients, the unbound amprenavir fraction was increased in the presence of lopinavir, but remained unaffected by ritonavir. It remains to be seen whether measurement of unbound concentrations, rather than total concentrations, could improve therapeutic drug monitoring."

16433887,Therapeutic drug monitoring and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antiretroviral therapy.,"Treatment with antiretroviral drugs such as the HIV protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors have contributed to the improvement of life of many HIV-infected patients in recent years, but antiretroviral therapy is not without problems. In some patients, treatment is not effective and suppression of viral replication is not achieved. Other patients experience toxicity and have to stop treatment or change to a less effective treatment. Several studies have demonstrated a relationship between plasma concentrations of the protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and viral suppression and toxicity. Therapeutic drug monitoring uses drug concentrations to individualize and optimise therapy by dosage adjustments and many clinicians have advocated for the use of therapeutic drug monitoring in HIV antiretroviral therapy. Evidence from a number of randomized clinical trials supports the use of therapeutic drug monitoring, but the studies have limitations and might not apply to all the antiretroviral drugs. However, the consensus is that certain patients are very likely to benefit from therapeutic drug monitoring. Additionally, the combination of therapeutic drug monitoring and genotypic or phenotypic resistance testing might further improve antiretroviral therapy."
16436725,Pharmacokinetics of enfuvirtide in patients treated in typical routine clinical settings.,"Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is gaining importance for improving the success of antiretroviral treatment in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients. However, enfuvirtide (ENF) concentrations are not regularly determined. The objective of this work was to study the pharmacokinetics (PK) of ENF in patients treated in routine clinical settings, to develop a population PK model describing the concentration-time profile, and to establish PK reference values. A liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was developed and applied to serum samples submitted for TDM. A two-compartment model with linear absorption and elimination was fitted to 329 concentrations from 131 patients. The PK model was used for simulations resulting in percentile curves for ENF levels for the full dosing interval. The model predicted that a median concentration of 1,968 ng/ml would be reached 12 h after administration of 90 mg of ENF, and 23% and 58% of patients are expected to have concentrations below 1,000 ng/ml and 2,200 ng/ml, respectively. Both values have been proposed as cutoffs for virological efficacy. The median maximum concentration of drug in serum (Cmax) of 3,943 ng/ml, predicted for 3 h after drug administration, is lower than the Cmax reported previously. We found an enormous interpatient variability at every time point, with concentration spectrums covering >1 log and 52% and 123% interindividual variabilities in the typical clearance and volume of distribution, respectively, in contrast to preexisting PK data. In summary, ENF levels are lower and more variable than expected. Many patients may achieve insufficient concentrations. Further covariate analysis in the population PK model might help to identify factors influencing the variability in ENF concentrations."

It is administered via a subcutaneous injection. The patient is responsible for reconstitution from a powder and self-injection. Nurses caring for patients using enfuvirtide need a solid knowledge base about enfuvirtide administration and side effects in order to effectively educate and manage patients taking enfuvirtide. Enfuvirtide's safety and efficacy reported from phase III trials are summarized. Nursing guidelines were developed by the Association of Nurses in AIDS Care Expert Panel on Enfuvirtide.

In addition, suggestions for proper syringe disposal and traveling with enfuvirtide are offered."
16462404,Increasing survival with HIV: impact on nursing care.,"The introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has transformed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection from a rapidly progressive catastrophic illness to a chronic condition. Individuals with HIV are living longer and developing conditions usually associated with aging, as well as complications from pre-existing or subsequently acquired conditions. In addition, toxicities associated with HAART may precipitate or exacerbate comorbid conditions. As opportunistic infections account for fewer admission and lower mortality rates, new patterns of illness are emerging. Complex interactions among multiple, sometimes overlapping conditions require focused yet comprehensive attention in care and management. Nurses will encounter HIV-infected patients in an increasing range of care settings, and an understanding of the range and interaction of potential comorbidities and their treatments with HIV and its treatment will be required to provide safe and effective care."
16465115,Unraveling the mystery of HIV medications.,"Today, millions of people around the globe are infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This retrovirus attacks and renders ineffective the human immune system and leads to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), which leaves those with AIDS open to a variety of fatal infections. HIV knows no racial, gender, or age distinctions, and there is, as yet, no cure for HIV. However, after 25 years of research, there are three classes of medication that in various combinations may significantly slow the progress of HIV, thus improving and prolonging the life of infected individuals. Nurses in any practice arena will inevitably care for patients who are infected with HIV. With an understanding of HIV and the therapeutic benefits of antiretroviral medications, informed nurses have the opportunity and responsibility to educate infected persons in the appropriate use of antiretroviral drugs and the importance of preventing transmission of HIV to uninfected persons."

Twenty-four HIV-1-infected subjects received lopinavir 400 mg/ritonavir 100 mg twice daily prior to and during the study: 6 each with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (and hepatitis C virus coinfected) and 12 with normal hepatic function. Mild and moderate hepatic impairment showed similar effects on lopinavir pharmacokinetics. When the 2 hepatic impairment groups were combined, lopinavir Cmax and AUC12 were increased 20% to 30% compared to the controls. Hepatic impairment increased unbound lopinavir AUC12 by 68% and Cmax by 56%. The effect of hepatic impairment on low-dose ritonavir pharmacokinetics was more pronounced in the moderate impairment group (181% and 221% increase in AUC12 and Cmax, respectively) than in the mild impairment group (39% and 61% increase in AUC12 and Cmax, respectively). While lopinavir/ritonavir dose reduction is not recommended in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, caution should be exercised in this population."
16515491,Update on the pharmacokinetic aspects of antiretroviral agents: implications in therapeutic drug monitoring.,"The observed inter-individual variation in antiretroviral pharmacokinetics (PK) that results in a wide range of drug exposures from fixed-dose regimens has led to increasing interest in the clinical use of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) to individualize dosing of antiretroviral therapy (ART). The focus of this review is to provide an overview of literature available to support therapeutic drug monitoring among the current classes of antiretrovirals, suggest patient populations that may benefit from TDM and bring forth some of the limitations that may exist for widespread use of TDM in a traditional clinical setting."
16533165,The role of unbound drug in pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and in therapy.,"The evolution of research on drug protein binding is discussed with the unbound concentration (Cu) and the unbound fraction (fu) as protagonists. Particular attention is paid to the mechanisms via which alterations in binding affect the pharmacokinetics (PK) and the effect, or independently the pharmacodynamics (PD). Apart from albumin, the important alpha-acid glycoprotein (AGP), as well as specific drug classes and applications in the clinic and development (routine monitoring, cancer and HIV therapy, allometry) are addressed. The flaws with the classical method of indirectly calculating the Cu or the unbound PK/PD parameters, based on the fu in vitro, are related to the intrinsic complexity and variability in the outcomes. Increased focus is urged on directly estimating the unbound PK/PD and also on using population statistical methods."
16545621,A reduced frequency visit schedule underreports adverse events that resulted in dose modifications or treatment discontinuations in HIV/AIDS clinical trials: ACTG DACS 207.,"BACKGROUND: Most large clinical trials for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) conducted at university medical centers require intensive real-time monitoring, with clinic visits at least every 4 to 8 weeks. Investigating a reduced frequency visit schedule will help determine whether the current amount of monitoring is needed to ensure subject safety. If we can show that subjects may visit the clinic less often than every 8 weeks and not miss important laboratory-related drug toxicities, then it may be feasible to conduct large studies with simpler designs without compromising the subjects' health. METHODS: In a retrospective analysis, we examined 3385 study participants who were enrolled in one of four clinical trials conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease AIDS Clinical Trials Group. Variables examined included age, sex, race, CD4 cell count, HIV antiretroviral use, and medications to treat or prevent selected HIV-associated opportunistic infections. RESULTS: Significantly more than the hypothesized 5% of clinic visits with at least one drug toxicity were missed when visits were either every 16 or 24 weeks instead of every 8 weeks (exact Poisson lower 95% confidence bounds = 9.7% and 9.2%, respectively). In both visit-skipping scenarios, there were no significant differences found in the rates of missed drug toxicities by sex or age. However, entry CD4 cell count, HIV antiretroviral use, and medications to treat or prevent two HIV-associated opportunistic infections significantly affected the expected mean number of missed drug toxicities. CONCLUSION: Study visits cannot be extended from every 8 weeks to every 16 or 24 weeks without potentially harming the subjects' health."
16550036,Drug-induced liver disease.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize the pertinent case reports, case series and clinical studies that described clinical, histological, epidemiological and mechanistic features of drug-induced liver disease in 2005. RECENT FINDINGS: Acetaminophen, highly active antiretroviral therapy and drugs for tuberculosis retained their preeminent position as the most commonly reported agents causing drug-induced liver disease, with acetaminophen continuing to be the leading cause of acute liver failure in the USA. While the frequency of drug-induced liver disease remains low, a large case-series of acute drug-induced liver disease from Spain and Sweden supported the observation that acute hepatocellular jaundice from a drug is associated with death or the need for transplant in at least 10% (known as Hy's Law). With respect to using potentially hepatotoxic medications in patients with underlying liver disease, statins and second-generation thiazolidinediones were shown to be safe when used in patients with elevated baseline alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase levels. SUMMARY: Drug-induced liver disease remains an important cause of acute liver failure, and research efforts by the National Institutes of Health and others are underway to better determine the risk factors and other host susceptibilities that will allow for the safer use of drugs in the future."
16575742,Can responses to antiretroviral therapy be improved by therapeutic drug monitoring?,
16595641,The use of pharmacokinetically guided indinavir dose reductions in the management of indinavir-associated renal toxicity.,"OBJECTIVES: Indinavir is associated with nephrotoxicity. Therapeutic drug monitoring of indinavir improves clinical outcome, but there is little data regarding therapeutic drug monitoring for patients with established indinavir-associated renal impairment. We prospectively studied the use of therapeutic drug monitoring in patients with virological success but established nephrotoxicity on an indinavir-containing regimen. METHODS: We measured indinavir C(trough)/C(2h), serum creatinine, pyuria, blood pressure (BP), weight and HIV RNA. The major endpoint of interest was the number of patients achieving a normal creatinine level 20 weeks following final indinavir dose adjustment. Primary analysis was by intention to treat (ITT). RESULTS: A total of 35 patients were enrolled; mean (SD) age 40.3 (5.8) years; mean (SD) BMI 21.5 (2.8) kg/m(2). At baseline 6/35 (17%) had a serum creatinine concentration within normal limits, but were offered enrolment because of previous nephrotoxicity (nephrolithiasis and/or abnormal serum creatinine), and a screening pharmacokinetic profile associated with increased nephrotoxicity risk. By ITT analysis 11/35 (31%) had normal creatinine at study end (P = 0.18). Of the 29 patients with abnormal creatinine at baseline, 7/29 (24.1%) had normal creatinine at study end (P = 0.016). Patients had a median (IQR) indinavir per dose adjustment over the study of 400 (400-800) mg. We observed improvements in estimated creatinine clearance, pyuria, resting BP and indinavir pharmacokinetic profile. HIV RNA control was maintained with continued immune recovery despite lower indinavir doses. CONCLUSIONS: Patients experiencing nephrotoxicity on an indinavir-containing regimen were safely maintained on indinavir by means of therapeutic drug monitoring. Parameters of renal function improved but did not return to baseline values, at least in the short-term."
16606636,Lopinavir/ritonavir exposure in treatment-naive HIV-infected children following twice or once daily administration.,"OBJECTIVES: Lopinavir/ritonavir is approved for treatment of HIV-infected children at a dosage regimen of 230/57.5 mg/m(2) twice daily. However, once daily administration could increase convenience and patient adherence. Our study aimed at evaluating whether inhibitory concentrations are maintained in plasma following administration of lopinavir/ritonavir once daily. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Lopinavir/ritonavir was administered at the standard twice daily regimen to 21 HIV-infected children, as a component of their antiretroviral treatment. Following at least 1 month of administration, seven patients received a dose of 460/115 mg/m(2) once daily for three consecutive days. After the third dose of once daily administration, blood samples were drawn at the following times: 0 (pre-dose), 1, 2 and 4 h following administration. The pre-dose (C(min)) and the peak (C(max)) concentrations were compared with the values obtained following twice daily administration in all the study patients. RESULTS: Median (interquartile range) C(min) with the once daily regimen was 1.59 (0.77-6.85) mg/L versus 7.90 (5.45-9.77) mg/L with the twice daily regimen (P < 0.05). C(min) was considered inhibitory for wild-type virus (>1.0 mg/L) in four out of seven patients. C(max) did not differ significantly between the once daily and twice daily regimens. CONCLUSIONS: Our small pilot study suggests that lopinavir/ritonavir once daily may be a suitable regimen for antiretroviral-naive children. However, due to the high interindividual variability and low concentrations in some patients, therapeutic drug monitoring may be necessary to ensure that concentrations are adequate to inhibit viral replication. A formal clinical study of lopinavir/ritonavir once daily in treatment-naive children is warranted."

16631422,Hepatotoxicity and antiretroviral therapy with protease inhibitors: A review.,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors has led to dramatic decrease in the morbidity and mortality resulting from infection with human immunodeficiency virus-1. However, this combination regimen can be associated with the occurrence of serious toxicities, which may reduce patient compliance. In particular, human immunodeficiency virus-1 protease inhibitors and nevirapine among nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, have the potential for producing hepatotoxicity. We summarise current knowledge of the hepatotoxic effects associated with the commercially available human immunodeficiency virus-1 protease inhibitors based on a literature review of the major retrospective and prospective clinical studies designed to elucidate risk factors for developing hepatotoxicity among human immunodeficiency virus-1-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy containing protease inhibitors. Coinfection with chronic hepatitis, a common occurrence in human immunodeficiency virus-1-infected patients, is identified as an independent risk factor for developing hepatotoxicity in antiretroviral-treated human immunodeficiency virus-1-infected patients treated with antiretroviral regimens containing protease inhibitors. The importance of other risk factors for developing protease inhibitor-associated hepatotoxicity and the mechanism underlying the drug-related hepatotoxicity are discussed. The data indicate that the potential for producing hepatotoxicity is variable among the protease inhibitors and suggest that based on differences in drug-related hepatotoxicity, certain protease inhibitors may be preferred for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus-hepatitis C virus coinfected patients."
16649742,API consensus guidelines for use of antiretroviral therapy in adults (API-ART guidelines). Endorsed by the AIDS Society of India.,"With rational use of antiretroviral therapy (ART), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has been transformed into a chronic manageable illness like diabetes and hypertension. These guidelines provide information on state of art, evidence based approach for use of ART in Indian context. When to initiate ART? Antiretroviral therapy is indicated for all symptomatic HIV infected persons regardless of CD4 counts and plasma viral load (PVL) levels. In asymptomatic patients, ART should be offered when the CD4 counts < 200/mm3 and should be considered in patients with CD4 counts between 200-250/mm3. Therapy is not recommended for patients with CD4 count more than 350/ mm3. Involvement of patient in all treatment decisions and assessing readiness is critical before initiating ART. What to start with? A non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) based regimen is recommended for antiretroviral naive patients. The choice between nevirapine and efavirenz is based on differences in adverse events profiles; cost and availability of convenient fixed dose combinations and need for concomitant use of rifampicin. A backbone of 2-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) is combined with the NNRTI. Various combinations and ART strategies not to be used in clinical practice has been enlisted. How to follow up? Recommendations have been made for baseline evaluation and monitoring of patients on ART. These include guidelines on laboratory and clinical evaluation. A plasma viral load at 6 months after initiation of first-line ART is strongly recommended. Yearly estimation of lipid profile has been recommended. How to identify and manage ART failure? The guidelines recognize the issue of identifying ART failure late if only CD4 counts are used for monitoring. In the absence of resistance testing various second-line regimens have been enlisted. A boosted protease inhibitor based regimen is recommended in this situation to be combined with 2-NRTIs. Special situations Recommendations have been made for use of ART in HIV-TB, HIV-HBV, and HIV-HCV co-infected patients. In patients with active TB and a CD4 count < 200/mm3, initiation of ART is recommended as soon as the anti-TB treatment is tolerated. Efavirenz is the only ARV drug, which can be safely used with rifampicin. In pregnancy use of single dose nevirapine for reducing risk of mother to child transmission of HIV is not recommended, because of the risk of development of resistance. For post-exposure prophylaxis taking ART treatment history of the source patient is crucial in designing an effective regimen."
16652054,Pharmacologic optimization of protease inhibitors and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (POPIN)--a randomized controlled trial of therapeutic drug monitoring and adherence support.,"We evaluated the feasibility and effectiveness of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) and adherence support (collectively, AT) vs standard of care (SOC) in patients receiving HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) within a nurse-led clinic. Primary end points were failure to achieve viral load of <50 copies/mL at 24 weeks, viral rebound, or development of treatment limiting toxicity. One hundred twenty-two patients (AT 63 and SOC 59) were followed-up every 12 weeks, for a median of 72 weeks. No difference was observed between arms in risk of reaching a study end point or between groups of patients with abnormal vs ""therapeutic"" drug concentrations. Interindividual variabilities (coefficient of variation) were the following: efavirenz, 77.5%; nevirapine, 74.5%; lopinavir, 73.4%; nelfinavir, 83.7%; indinavir, 80.8%; saquinavir, 112.4%. Intraindividual variabilities (median coefficient of variation) were the following: NNRTIs, approximately 25%; PIs, 48.4%. Despite persistently abnormal results in 26 of patients in the AT arm (38%), dosage adjustment was only undertaken in 9 patients (35%).A significant proportion of patients had drug concentrations outside the therapeutic range. The Pharmacologic Optimization of PIs and NNRTIs (POPIN) study confirms that TDM trials are complex to interpret and statistically underpowered, with effectiveness better assessed through the clinical utility of a TDM result, whether normal or abnormal. Although TDM of PIs and NNRTIs may be useful in selected patients, routine and unselected use is not supported by current evidence."
16687458,Predictors of short-term success of antiretroviral therapy in HIV infection.,"OBJECTIVES: The success of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in HIV infection may be influenced by numerous host factors. There is a lack of data presenting a combined assessment of a variety of these parameters for treatment efficacy in clinical routine practice. METHODS: Different indices of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) were evaluated prospectively in the context of self-reported adherence, health-related quality of life and social determinants, as measured by a questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 210 individuals were studied between 2002 and 2004, 77% were males, mean age was 44 years, mean CD4 count was 336 cells/mm3 and 63% had a viral load < 50 copies/mL. In univariate analysis, baseline viral load, unscheduled drug levels, a 4 h pharmacokinetic profile (PK-P) at a scheduled visit and self-reported complete adherence within the previous 2 weeks were significantly associated with virological success of HAART at 12 weeks. At 24 weeks, only baseline viral load, the 4 h PK-P and adherence were significantly associated with HAART efficacy. In multivariate analysis, baseline viral load, adherence, unscheduled drug levels, trough levels at a visit with appointment as well as the 4 h PK-P were significantly associated with virological success at 12 weeks. At 24 weeks, only adherence was significantly linked to outcome. The other parameters were not found to have an impact on treatment efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: TDM and self-reported adherence were independently predictive of short-term HAART success in this prospective study. Unscheduled drug measurements provided similar diagnostic information as a 4 h PK-P. Thus, we propose the use of unscheduled drug level monitoring and self-reported adherence to help identify patients with elevated risk of virological failure."
16691064,"Atazanavir and lopinavir/ritonavir: pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of a promising double-boosted protease inhibitor regimen.","OBJECTIVE: To assess the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of lopinavir (LPV), ritonavir (RTV) and atazanavir (ATV) as a double-boosted protease inhibitor regimen in HIV-infected adults. METHODS: Sixteen patients who started LPV/RTV (400/100 mg b.i.d.) and ATV (300 mg q.d.) were enrolled in the study group (arm A). LPV pharmacokinetics were compared to those of two historical groups: arm B, 15 patients who received LPV/RTV (400/100 mg b.i.d.); and arm C, 25 patients who received LPV/RTV/saquinavir (SQV) (400/100/1000 mg b.i.d.). ATV pharmacokinetics were compared to those of 15 consecutive patients who received ATV and RTV (300/100 mg q.d.) (arm D). Drug concentrations were measured by HPLC. RESULTS: LPV concentrations were significantly higher in arm A than in arms B and C. Median (interquartile range) LPV area under the curve (AUC)0-12 values were 115.7 (99.8-136.5), 85.2 (68.3-109.2) and 85.1 (60.6-110.1) microg/h/ml, respectively. C(max) values were 12.2 (10.7-14.5), 9.5 (6.8-13.9) and 10.0 (6.9-13.6) microg/ml, respectively. C(min) values were 9.1 (7.1-10.4), 5.6 (4.7-8.2) and 5.5 (4.2-7.5) microg/ml, respectively. No difference was observed for ATV AUC0-24 or C(max) between arms A and D. ATV C(min) values were 1.07 (0.61-1.79) in arm A and 0.58 (0.32-0.83) in arm D (P = 0.001). Treatment was not discontinued in any patient because of adverse effects. At 24 weeks, viral load was < 50 copies/ml in 13 of 16 patients. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of ATV and LPV/RTV provided high plasma concentrations of both PI, which seemed to be appropriate for patients with multiple prior therapeutic failures, yielding good tolerability and substantial antiviral efficacy."
16723569,Pregnancy-related effects on nelfinavir-M8 pharmacokinetics: a population study with 133 women.,"A relationship between nelfinavir antiretroviral efficacy and plasma concentrations has been previously established. As physiological changes associated with pregnancy have a large impact on the pharmacokinetics of many drugs, a nelfinavir population study with women was developed, and the large intersubject variability was analyzed in order to optimize individual treatment schedules for this drug during pregnancy. A population pharmacokinetic model was developed in order to describe the concentration time course of nelfinavir and its metabolite M8 in pregnant and nonpregnant women. Individual characteristics, such as age, body weight, and weeks of gestation or delivery, which may influence nelfinavir-M8 pharmacokinetics were investigated. Data from therapeutic drug monitoring in 133 women treated with nelfinavir were retrospectively analyzed with NONMEM. Nelfinavir pharmacokinetics was described by a one-compartment model with linear absorption and elimination and M8 produced from the nelfinavir central compartment. Mean pharmacokinetic estimates and the corresponding intersubject percent variabilities for a nonpregnant woman were the following: absorption rate, 0.83 h(-1); absorption lag time, 0.85 h; apparent nelfinavir elimination clearance (CL(10)/F), 35.5 liters/h (50%); apparent volume of distribution (V/F), 596 liters (118%); apparent formation clearance to M8 (CL(1M)/F), 0.65 liters/h (69%); and M8 elimination rate constant (k(M0)), 3.3 h(-1) (59%). During pregnancy, we observed significant increases in nelfinavir (44.4 liters/h) and M8 (5 h(-1)) elimination but unchanged nelfinavir transformation clearance to M8, suggesting an induction of CYP3A4 but no effect on CYP2C19. Apparent nelfinavir clearance and volume showed a twofold increase on the day of delivery, suggesting a decrease in bioavailability on this day. The M8 elimination rate was increased by concomitant administration of nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. A trough nelfinavir plasma concentration above 1 mg/liter was previously shown to improve the antiretroviral response. The Bayesian individual pharmacokinetic estimates suggested that the dosage should not be changed in pregnant women but may be doubled on the day of delivery."

16765009,Simple determination of the HIV protease inhibitor atazanavir in human plasma by high-performance liquid chromatography with UV detection.,"A simple high-performance liquid chromatography method for the determination of the human immunodeficiency virus protease inhibitor atazanavir in human plasma samples was developed and validated. The method involved a rapid and simple solid-phase extraction of atazanavir using Oasis HLB 1cc cartridges, an isocratic reversed-phase liquid chromatography on an XTerra RP18 (150mmx4.6mm, 3.5microm) column, and ultraviolet detection at 203nm. The mobile phase consisted of phosphate buffer (pH 6, 52.5mM) and acetonitrile (43:57, v/v). Up to 48 samples could be measured in one day since the run-time of one sample was 30min. The assay was linear from 0.04 to 10microg/ml with a lower limit of quantification of 0.04microg/ml. The mean absolute recovery of ATV was 98.1%. The method was precise, with both intra-day and inter-day coefficients of variation < or =3.0%, and accurate (deviations ranged from -3.0% to 4.5% and from -3.6% to 4.7% for intra-day and inter-day analysis, respectively). There was no interference from 35 tested potentially co-administrated drugs. This method provides a simple, sensitive, precise and reproducible assay for the therapeutic drug monitoring of atazanavir in clinical routine of laboratories with standard equipment."
16778716,Are plasma levels valid surrogates for cellular concentrations of antiretroviral drugs in HIV-infected patients?,"Total plasma concentrations are currently measured for therapeutic drug monitoring of HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). However, the pharmacological target of antiretroviral drugs reside inside cells. To study the variability of their cellular accumulation, and to determine to which extent total plasma concentrations (TPC) correlate with cellular concentrations (CC), plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were simultaneously collected at single random times after drug intake from 133 HIV infected patients. TPC levels were analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection and CC by LC-MS/MS from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The best correlations between TPC and CC were observed for nelfinavir (NFV, slope=0.93, r=0.85), saquinavir (SQV, slope=0.76, r=0.80) and lopinavir (LPV, slope=0.87, r=0.63). By contrast, TPC of efavirenz (EFV) exhibited a moderate correlation with CC (slope=0.69, r=0.58), while no correlation was found for nevirapine (NVP, slope=-0.3, r=0.1). Interindividual variability in the CC/TPC ratio was lower for protease inhibitors (coefficients of variation 76%, 61%, and 80% for SQV, NFV and LPV, respectively) than for nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (coefficients of variation 101% and 318%, for EFV and NVP). As routine CC measurement raises practical difficulties, well-correlated plasma concentrations (ie, NFV, SQV and LPV) can probably be considered as appropriate surrogates for cellular drug exposure. For drugs such as EFV or NVP, there may be room for therapeutic drug monitoring improvement using either direct CC determination or other predictive factors such as genotyping of transporters or metabolizing enzyme genes."
16778721,"Quality assurance program for pharmacokinetic assay of antiretrovirals: ACTG proficiency testing for pediatric and adult pharmacology support laboratories, 2003 to 2004: a requirement for therapeutic drug monitoring.","Proficiency testing (PT) is a mandated requirement for clinical laboratories doing therapeutic drug monitoring and is an invaluable tool to help laboratories identify and correct problems in analytical procedures. The AIDS Clinical Trial Group Pharmacology Quality Assurance Committee implemented a new antiretroviral PT program for all currently available antiretroviral drugs in 2001. The PT program was designed for the AIDS Clinical Trial Group Pharmacology Specialty Laboratories actively involved in assaying these drugs in clinical trial samples so as to comply with the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. Results from the first 3 rounds of PT have been analyzed and reported and provided support for formalizing the guidelines of the PT testing program. The PT program has expanded with the addition of nucleoside reverse transcription inhibitors (NRTIs) and atazanavir. This report includes results from rounds 4 to 7 over 2 additional years of standard operations. Additionally we include results from NRTIs for all rounds and atazanavir for a single round. There were 9 participating laboratories. Eight used high-performance liquid chromatography as the primary method of detection and 2/8 also reported LC-MS-MS results. One laboratory used LC-MS-MS as their primary detection method. All laboratories measured protease inhibitors, most measured at least 1 non-nucleoside reverse transcription inhibitor and 5 had NRTI capabilities. Results were normally distributed and the acceptance range of +/-20% best corresponded to a 95% confidence interval. Overall score for 9 participating laboratories was 96% correct out of 1826 challenges over 4 rounds. Laboratories scored 95, 98 and 97% correct for protease inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcription inhibitorss and NRTIs, respectively. Three laboratories reporting LC-MS-MS results had 92% correct (347/378) challenges for all drugs. The percentage of correct results is about the same as previously reported. There is a continued need for a PT program to help participating laboratories maintain essential quality assurance and quality control."
16783049,Urine nevirapine as a predictor of antiretroviral adherence.,"BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Incomplete adherence is a major contributor to failure of antiretroviral therapy. Although the available methods to monitor adherence to therapy have proved to be predictive of outcomes, the results are variable. We assessed the feasibility of detecting nevirapine (NVP) in spot urine samples to monitor patient adherence to antiretroviral treatment and to study the urinary excretion of NVP in healthy volunteers after oral administration of a single dose of NVP (200 mg). METHODS: Spot urine samples were collected from 50 HIV-infected patients (36 on treatment regimen containing NVP and 14 on drugs other than NVP) and tested for NVP by HPLC in a blinded manner. Sixteen healthy volunteers (9 males and 7 females) were administered a single oral dose of 200 mg NVP and spot urine samples were collected on day '0' before drug administration, and thereafter every 24 h up to 9 days and tested for NVP. RESULTS: All the urine samples collected from patients undergoing treatment with NVP-containing regimens at different time points after drug administration tested positive for NVP. Thirteen out of 14 samples from patients not on NVP yielded a negative result. The drug was detected in the urine of healthy volunteers up to 9 days. The urinary excretion of NVP was prolonged in females than in males. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: In view of its long half-life, NVP gets excreted in urine for a long period of time. Hence, testing spot urine samples for NVP may not be a useful measure to monitor patient adherence to treatment."
16798621,Therapeutic drug monitoring in HIV treatment: a literature review.,"PURPOSE: Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is the practice of managing plasma drug concentrations. This intervention can potentially improve inadequate antiretroviral dosing in the treatment of HIV infection. Our objective was to review the evidence regarding TDM in HIV management. METHOD: We searched MEDLINE using the following key words: therapeutic drug monitoring, HIV infection, pharmacokinetics, antiretroviral therapy, protease inhibitors, antiretroviral-naive, antiretroviral-experienced, and salvage therapy. inclusion criteria required definition of optimal concentration thresholds and measures of treatment effectiveness at these targets. RESULTS: Our search yielded 39 studies. 11 studies met inclusion criteria. 4 studies compared efficacy of TDM to standard of care (SOC) interventions via randomized clinical trials and were grouped as ""interventional."" 7 studies retrospectively defined thresholds from observed differences in outcome and were grouped as ""observational."" 3 interventional studies targeted similar indinavir concentrations (Cmin = 0.10-0.15 mg/L). 2 of these studies increased achievement of target serum levels and percentages of undetectable viral load (23%-41%, p < or = .009) with TDM implementation. CONCLUSION: TDM can effectively target antiretroviral threshold concentrations and improve virologic suppression in some cases. Further work is needed to define plasma thresholds and assess the value of TDM in HIV management."
16804749,Assessing antiretroviral adherence via electronic drug monitoring and self-report: an examination of key methodological issues.,"We explored methodological issues related to antiretroviral adherence assessment, using 6 months of data collected in a completed intervention trial involving 136 low-income HIV-positive outpatients in the Bronx, NY. Findings suggest that operationalizing adherence as a continuous (versus dichotomous) variable and averaging adherence estimates over multiple assessment points (versus using only one) explains greater variance in HIV-1 RNA viral load (VL). Self-reported estimates provided during a phone interview accounted for similar variance in VL as EDM estimates (R (2) = .17 phone versus .18 EDM). Self-reported adherence was not associated with a standard social desirability measure, and no difference in the accuracy of self-report adherence was observed for assessment periods of 1-3 days. Self-reported poor adherence was more closely associated with EDM adherence estimates than self-reported moderate and high adherence. On average across assessment points, fewer than 4% of participants who reported taking a dose of an incorrect amount of medication."

16810112,Range of normal neutrophil counts in healthy zimbabwean infants: implications for monitoring antiretroviral drug toxicity.,"Mother-to-child HIV prevention trials in sub-Saharan Africa use the US National Institutes of Health Division of AIDS (DAIDS) grading scale to monitor hematologic toxicity. A recent study of nevirapine prophylaxis given for 6 months in breast-feeding Zimbabwean infants reported several cases of relative neutropenia in clinically well infants, raising concerns of drug toxicity. However, the DAIDS tables are based on normal blood counts for white infants, although there is evidence that black African infants may have lower absolute neutrophil counts (ANCs) than white infants. To establish normal hematologic values in black Zimbabwean infants and to quantify the apparent prevalence of relative neutropenia in this population, we evaluated HIV-uninfected healthy infants born to HIV-uninfected women at birth, 10 days, 6 weeks, 3, and 4 months of life. A physical examination and blood count were performed at each visit, and an HIV test was performed at the final visit. The ANC values were graded using the DAIDS table. A total of 145 healthy term infants satisfied the inclusion criteria. The mean ANC values for Zimbabwean infants were less than half of the corresponding standard values at all 5 time points (P < 0.0001). Using the DAIDS table in use at the time that the blood was collected, 57% of these healthy infants had relative neutropenia of any grade at birth, followed by 29% at day 10, 53% at 6 weeks, 32% at 3 months, and 37% at 4 months of life. Our data indicate that relative neutropenia exists in healthy black Zimbabwean infants. The guidelines for identifying toxicity were changed in December 2004. However, even by the new DAIDS tables, 43%, 23%, 24%, 42%, and 43% of these healthy babies had relative neutropenia at the time of the 5 visits. Future HIV prevention and treatment trials in sub-Saharan Africa should use normal hematologic values derived from African infants to avoid the overestimation of antiretroviral drug toxicity."
16847404,National adult antiretroviral therapy guidelines in resource-limited countries: concordance with 2003 WHO guidelines?,"AIMS: To investigate the existence of national adult antiretroviral therapy (ART) guidelines in 43 World Health Organization (WHO) '3 by 5' focus countries and compare their content with the 2003 WHO ART guidelines. METHODS: Questionnaires covered initiation of ART, selection of first or second-line ART, monitoring treatment response and toxicity and dissemination of national guidelines. Weighted concordance scores were created and country scores correlated with national indicators and WHO recommendations. RESULTS: Thirty-nine (91%) countries returned questionnaires, three of which had no national ART guidelines. Of the 36, 16 (44%) recommended to start ART based on WHO clinical staging criteria and CD4 cell count or T-lymphocyte count, 12 (33%) WHO clinical staging criteria and CD4 cell count, four (11%) only CD4 cell counts. 35 (97%) recommended a standard first-line regimen and 24 (67%) preferred stavudine + lamivudine + nevirapine; 33 (92%) recommended second-line regimens, and 24 (60%) preferred abacavir + didanosine + lopinavir/ritonavir. Thirty-one (94%) recommended CD4 cell count, possibly combined with other indicators, to monitor ART. Concordance scores were higher in countries with lower health expenditure per capita (P = 0.009) and lower GDP per capita (P < 0.03). Median concordance scores for starting ART was 100 [interquartile range (IQR), 67 to 100]; first line therapy, 70 (IQR, 60 to 80); second-line regimens, 45 (IQR, 27 to 55) and for laboratory investigations, 80 (IQR, 80 to 100). CONCLUSIONS: Most countries had developed national ART guidelines as part of a comprehensive national HIV program. Concordance with WHO recommendations was strong on starting first-line ART regimens and routine monitoring but lower for second-line recommendations."
16857630,Genotyping of CYP2B6 and therapeutic drug monitoring in an HIV-infected patient with high efavirenz plasma concentrations and severe CNS side-effects.,"We present a case with important pharmacogenetic and pharmacokinetic aspects of antiretroviral therapy in a patient with high efavirenz concentrations, severe CNS side-effects and low lopinavir concentrations. Despite therapeutic drug monitoring and subsequent efavirenz dosage reductions, side-effects did not resolve completely and lopinavir concentrations remained relatively low."
16863456,Pharmacokinetic drug interactions with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors.,"Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) are a diverse group of compounds that inhibit HIV Type 1 reverse transcriptase. Although possessing a common mechanism of action, the approved NNRTIs, delavirdine, efavirenz and nevirapine, differ in structural and pharmacokinetic characteristics. Each of the NNRTIs undergoes biotransformation by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system, thus making them prone to clinically significant drug interactions when combined with other antiretrovirals. In addition, they interact with other concurrent medications and complementary/alternative medicines, acting as either inducers or inhibitors of drug-metabolising CYP enzymes. These drug interactions become an important consideration in the clinical use of these agents when designing combination regimens, as recommended by current guidelines. This review provides an updated summary of pharmacokinetic interactions with NNRTIs."
16885718,Determination of tipranavir in human plasma by reverse phase liquid chromatography with UV detection using photodiode array.,"Tipranavir has recently received accelerated approval from the FDA. The initial clinical use of tipranavir will be for patients with prior virologic failure with the presence of key HIV-1 protease inhibitor mutations. In Phase III trials patients with greater virologic response also had higher trough tipranavir concentrations (BI product information 2005). In addition, hepatotoxicity was concentration-related with a higher incidence in those patients exceeding a trough plasma concentration of 48.2 microg/mL (80 microM). Therefore, tipranavir may be an HIV-1 protease inhibitor for which therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) may be helpful in optimizing outcomes. To quantitate tipranavir concentrations in human plasma, a method using reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) was validated. Detection was effected using a photodiode-array detector, scanning at a wavelength of 254 nm. This method allows for detection of tipranavir to a lower limit of quantitation of 0.390 microg/mL with an interday variation in control value ranging from 2.9 to 4.6%. The method is being used in a clinical therapeutic drug monitoring program that is ongoing in our laboratory."
16885719,Full validation of an analytical method for the HIV-protease inhibitor atazanavir in combination with 8 other antiretroviral agents and its applicability to therapeutic drug monitoring.,"Because HIV medications are used in combination, it is important to develop multiplex assays to streamline the therapeutic drug monitoring process and provide rapid turnaround. This article reports full validation of an analytical method that combines atazanavir with 6 HIV-protease inhibitors (indinavir, amprenavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, and lopinavir) and 2 nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (nevirapine and efavirenz). Using 200 microL of plasma and a simple liquid-liquid extraction method, this analytical method achieved a clean baseline and high extraction efficiencies (90.0% to 99.5%). A Zorbax C-18 (150 x 4.6 mm, 3.5 microm) analytical column was used along with a 27-minute linear gradient elution of the mobile phase to provide sharp peaks at 210 nm. This method was validated over a range of 25 to 10,000 ng/mL and is accurate (90.4% to 110.5%) and precise (precision within a day and between days ranged from 2.3% to 8.3%). Because this method is simple and inexpensive, it may have applicability in countries with low resources."
16940819,HIV and pregnancy: considerations for nursing practice.,"This article describes current nursing practice for pregnant women with HIV. In the United States, the number of new cases of HIV continues to rise in women of childbearing age. Women often learn of their HIV status when a pregnancy involves them in the healthcare delivery system. Since the manifestation of the disease in 1981, there have been significant advances in treatment, and now, among pregnant women testing positive for HIV, the risk of perinatal transmission can be decreased to 1% with pharmacologic intervention. Yet, HIV disease poses many new challenges to the woman testing positive who is considering pregnancy or who is already pregnant. The progression of the symptoms of AIDS is similar to the common symptoms of pregnancy; the HIV medications may also cause these symptoms. Adherence to the HIV medication regime is necessary for ongoing viral suppression, for missed doses can initiate drug resistance and the whole categories of antiretroviral drugs may become ineffective. Additionally, the HIV stigma continues to impact those infected and interferes with the access to healthcare. HIV poses a major challenge for the nurse caring for the childbearing woman."
16970510,Neuropsychiatric complications of antiretroviral therapy.,"Neuropsychiatric adverse effects related to potent antiretroviral therapy are among the complications that can lead to poor adherence, treatment interruptions, or change of antiretroviral therapy regimens. For a historical perspective, we review early literature and case reports with CNS adverse effects attributed to antiretrovirals. The variability of the cerebrospinal fluid penetration of individual antiretrovirals may contribute to their potential for behavioural and psychiatric manifestations. The majority of neuropsychiatric complications related to potent antiretroviral therapy have been associated with the use of the efavirenz. Updates on the risk of neuropsychiatric manifestations with efavirenz use in patients with a history of psychiatric disorders or substance abuse are reviewed. We include a critical review of recently published data on the long-term CNS adverse effects with efavirenz. Special attention is given to the results of recent investigations on the relationship between the pharmacogenomics of genes responsible for efavirenz metabolism and the plasma concentration of efavirenz. It is important to note that there is no established direct correlation of efavirenz concentrations and symptoms. It is not recommended for practitioners to adjust efavirenz doses in order to prevent or alleviate CNS adverse effects. Patients may be placed at risk for virological failure and resistance if they receive suboptimal doses of efavirenz. The aim of this article is to give a concise review and an update on recent literature concerning neuropsychiatric effects of antiretroviral use in HIV-infected patients. Our intent is to present practitioners with data that can be used in a practical way to both educate and improve outcomes in the HIV-infected patient population."
16997640,"Simultaneous determination of 8 HIV protease inhibitors in human plasma by isocratic high-performance liquid chromatography with combined use of UV and fluorescence detection: amprenavir, indinavir, atazanavir, ritonavir, lopinavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir and M8-nelfinavir metabolite.","A simple, accurate and fast method was developed for determination of the commonly used HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) amprenavir, indinavir, atazanavir, ritonavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, M8-nelfinavir metabolite and saquinavir in human plasma. Liquid-liquid extraction was used with hexane/ethylacetate from buffered plasma samples with a borate buffer pH 9.0. Isocratic chromatographic separation of all components was performed on an Allsphere hexyl HPLC column with combined UV and fluorescence detection. Calibration curves were constructed in the range of 0.025-10 mg/l. Accuracy and precision of the standards were all below 15% and the lowest limit of quantitation was 0.025 mg/l. Stability of quality control samples at different temperature conditions was found to be below 20% of nominal values. The advantages of this method are: (1) inclusion and determination of the newly approved atazanavir, (2) simultaneous isocratic HPLC separation of all compounds and (3) increased specificity and sensitivity for amprenavir by using fluorescence detection. This method can be used for therapeutic drug monitoring of all PIs currently commercialised and is now part of current clinical practice."
17038880,A retrospective TDM database analysis of interpatient variability in the pharmacokinetics of lopinavir in HIV-infected adults.,"Lopinavir is one of the most-widely used protease inhibitors in the treatment of HIV-1 infected patients. Concentration-effect relationships have been described for both antiviral activity and toxicity. Less is known about patient characteristics that may determine interpatient variability in lopinavir plasma concentrations. A database was created containing all Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) results collected at our Department. Patients were included if they were using lopinavir twice daily for at least two weeks; subjects who were known to be nonadherent (based on either a lopinavir concentration <0.2 mg/L or suspected by the physician) were excluded. Demographic data were collected from TDM application forms and patient charts. Patients attending one of the 22 HIV treatment centers in The Netherlands. The Department of Clinical Pharmacy is a national referral center for TDM of antiretroviral agents. Lopinavir concentration ratios (CRs) were calculated for each patient by dividing the individual plasma concentration by the time-adjusted population value. Relationships with lopinavir CRs were tested using regression analysis and analysis of variance. A total of 802 patients were included (607 males; 150 females; 45 unknown). The age and body weight of the patients ranged from 18 to 74 years (mean 42) and 42 to 121 kg (mean 72), respectively. Race was known for 756 persons: Caucasian 76%, African 18% and Asian 6%. The median (+ interquartile range, IQR) lopinavir CR was 0.98 (IQR: 0.67-1.31). Body weight showed an inverse relationship with lopinavir CR (F = 23.1; P < 0.001). Age was not related with lopinavir CR (P = 0.99). Female patients had a significantly higher lopinavir CR than males: 1.18 vs. 1.03 (P = 0.005); race was not associated with differences in lopinavir CR. In a multivariate regression analysis body weight, but not gender, remained significantly related to lopinavir CR. Body weight is the only demographic factor that could be related to lopinavir exposure; clinicians should be alert for an increased risk of suboptimal antiviral efficacy in patients with high body weight, and for an increased risk of toxicity in patients with a low body weight."

After a 4-week baseline observation phase, eligible participants (N=66) were randomly assigned to: (a) medication coaching sessions every other week to assist with adherence strategies (comparison group) or (b) medication coaching plus voucher reinforcement for opening electronic medication caps on time (voucher group). Baseline adherence (percent doses taken/percent total possible doses) was 51% using electronic measurement, 75% using self-report and 75% using pill count. The intervention was provided for 12 weeks, with a 4-week follow-up. The primary outcome results of the clinical trial indicated effectiveness during the intervention, with significant mean adherence differences between voucher and comparison groups using electronic measurement (78% versus 56%), pill count (86% versus 75%), and self-report (87% versus 69%). Differences between groups faded after vouchers were discontinued. Contingency management shows promise as a strategy to promote antiretroviral medication adherence in this population."
17101460,Need for therapeutic drug monitoring in HIV-1 infected children receiving efavirenz doses according to international guidelines.,"BACKGROUND: International guidelines for the treatment of HIV-1 infected children recommend efavirenz plus nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor combination therapy for first line therapy. Until now little is known about the steady state pharmacokinetics of efavirenz in children. METHODS: 11 HIV-1 infected children at the age of 4 to 10 years received efavirenz according to body weight adjusted dose recommendations at 10 -15 mg/kg body weight. All children were non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) naive, 5/11 received efavirenz as first line therapy. Efavirenz plasma concentrations were assessed before daily dose and 1, 2, 4, 8, 24 h post-dose after medication by established HPLC. RESULTS: 7 of 11 children exhibited efavirenz plasma concentrations below targeted ranges. Mean (95% CI) minimum concentrations (C subsetmin) was 1293 ng/mL (range: 889 -1697) and maximum concentration (C subsetmax) was 5552 ng/mL (3951 - 7153) and the mean area under the time-concentration curve at steady state (AUCss) was 63608 ng*h/mL (44222 - 82989). The linear regression analysis of bodyweight adjusted efavirenz AUCss showed a close correlation between dose/bodyweight and plasma concentrations (r superset2 = 0.79). Efavirenz doses below 12.5 mg/kg lead to an AUC < 60000 ng*h/mL in 7 of 8 cases. Higher efavirenz doses exhibited an AUC within the recommended therapeutic range of 60000 - 120000 ng*h/mL (n = 3). CONCLUSIONS: The data show insufficient plasma concentrations for some children despite efavirenz dosing according to recommendations. Antiretroviral therapy needs to be carefully adjusted in children. Therapeutic drug monitoring is strongly recommended to meet efavirenz plasma levels within the therapeutic range."
17133208,Adjusting and censoring electronic monitoring device data. Implications for study outcomes.,"Electronic monitoring device (EMD) data are widely used to measure adherence in HIV medication adherence research. EMD data represent an objective measure of adherence and arguably provide more valid data than other methods such as self-reported measures, pill counts, and drug level concentration. Moreover, EMD data are longitudinal, include many measurements, and yield a rich data set. This article illustrates potential pitfalls associated with this measurement technique, including lack of clarity associated with EMD data, and the extent to which adherence outcomes are affected by data management decisions. Recommendations are given regarding what information should be included in publications that report results based on EMD data so as to facilitate comparisons between studies."
17181373,Tuberculosis and HIV co-infection: a practical therapeutic approach.,"HIV and tuberculosis (TB) are leading global causes of mortality and morbidity, and yet effective treatment exists for both conditions. Rifamycin-based antituberculosis therapy can cure HIV-related TB and, where available, the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has markedly reduced the incidence of AIDS and death. Optimal treatment regimens for HIV/TB co-infection are not yet clearly defined. Combinations are limited by alterations in the activity of the hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system, which in particular may produce subtherapeutic plasma concentrations of antiretroviral drugs. For example, protease inhibitors often must be avoided if the potent CYP inducer rifampicin is co-administered. However, an alternative rifamycin, rifabutin, which has similar efficacy to rifampicin, can be used with appropriate dose reduction. Available clinical data suggest that, for the majority of individuals, rifampicin-based regimens can be successfully combined with the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors nevirapine and efavirenz. Most available HAART regimens in areas that have a high burden of TB contain one or the other of these drugs as a backbone. However, significant questions remain as to the optimal dose of either agent required to ensure therapeutic plasma concentrations, especially in relation to particular ethnic groups. The timing of HAART initiation after starting antituberculosis therapy continues to be controversial. Debate centres upon whether early initiation of HAART increases the risk of paradoxical reactions (immune reconstitution-related events) and other adverse events, or whether delay greatly elevates the risk of disease progression. Further prospective clinical data are needed to help inform practice in this area."

Using a fixed-dose combination of stavudine+lamivudine+nevirapine ('Triomune') as the first-line regimen, split tablets are given to children with doses according to body weight. By March 2006, a total of 46 702 patients had been started on ART, of whom 2718 (5.8%) were children aged <15 years. In a subset of 935 children, comprising 486 boys and 449 girls, 1.5% were aged <1 year, 26% were aged 1-4 years, 39% were aged 5-9 years and 33% were aged 10-14 years. Between July and September 2005, 7905 patients started ART, comprising 7469 adults and 436 children. Six-month cohort outcomes censored on 31 March 2006 showed significantly more children alive and significantly fewer children dead or defaulted compared with adults. Between January and March 2005, 4580 patients started ART, comprising 4347 adults and 233 children. Twelve-month cohort outcomes censored on 31 March 2006 showed significantly more children alive compared with adults. The results of this national study should encourage other programmes to invest in ART for children and particularly to monitor their treatment outcomes."

17253884,Efavirenz and nevirapine in HIV-1 infection : is there a role for clinical pharmacokinetic monitoring?,"Nevirapine and efavirenz are nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors used in antiretroviral regimens to treat HIV infection. Therapeutic drug monitoring in patients on antiretroviral regimens that include these agents has been suggested to be beneficial in terms of efficacy and toxicity. Various analytical methods are available to quantify nevirapine and efavirenz concentrations. A previously published, nine-step, decision-making algorithm has been used to evaluate the utility of therapeutic drug monitoring of efavirenz and nevirapine. A relationship has been found between efavirenz concentrations and toxicity and between nevirapine concentrations and virological efficacy. For efavirenz, the recommended therapeutic range is 1-4 mg/L; for nevirapine, minimum trough concentrations of >3.4 mg/L have been suggested. Both drugs have demonstrated interindividual pharmacokinetic variability. The pharmacokinetic parameters of nevirapine vary in female patients, patients coinfected with hepatitis B virus, and patients from different geographical locations. The pharmacokinetic parameters of efavirenz have also been shown to vary depending on patients' race, baseline bilirubin level, and geographical location. Drug interactions and resistance mutations can also be confounders in the pharmacokinetic parameters of these drugs. Coinfection with hepatitis C can also contribute to increased drug concentrations. The risk of hepatotoxicity can be increased in the presence of elevated nevirapine concentrations. As patients with HIV-1 infection will be managed with different combinations of antiretroviral regimens over the course of their lives, the limitations of having only four drug classes from which to choose make it even more important to maximise the usefulness of each of these drug classes. The available evidence suggests that therapeutic drug monitoring of efavirenz and nevirapine may contribute to the clinician's ability to evaluate efficacy and safety in patients taking these drugs. Patients at risk of toxicity from drug interactions or disease interactions and patients who may be noncompliant may gain the greatest benefit from therapeutic drug monitoring of efavirenz and nevirapine."
17261244,[Recommendations from the GESIDA/Spanish AIDS Plan regarding antiretroviral treatment in adults with human immunodeficiency virus infection (update January 2007)].,"OBJECTIVE: This consensus document is an update of antiretroviral therapy (ART) recommendations for adult patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1). METHODS: To formulate these recommendations, a panel composed of members of the Grupo de Estudio de Sida (GESIDA; AIDS Study Group) and the Plan Nacional sobre el Sida (PNS; Spanish AIDS Plan) reviewed the advances in the current understanding of the pathophysiology of HIV, the safety and efficacy findings from clinical trials, and the results from cohort and pharmacokinetic studies published in biomedical journals or presented at scientific meetings over the last years. Three levels of evidence were defined according to the source of the data: randomized studies (level A), cohort or case-control studies (level B), and expert opinion (level C). The decision to recommend, consider or not recommend ART was established in each situation. RESULTS: Currently, the treatment of choice for chronic HIV infection is the combination of three drugs of two different classes, including 2 nucleosides or nucleotide analogs (NRTI) plus 1 non-nucleoside (NNRTI) or 1 boosted protease inhibitor (PI/r). Initiation of ART is recommended in patients with symptomatic HIV infection. In asymptomatic patients, initiation of ART is recommended on the basis of CD4+ lymphocyte counts and plasma viral load, as follows: 1) therapy should be started in patients with CD4+ counts of < 200 cells/microl; 2) therapy should be started in most patients with CD4+ counts of 200-350 cells/microl, although it can be delayed when CD41 count persists at around 350 cells/microL and viral load is low, and 3) initiation of therapy can be delayed in patients with CD4+ counts of > 350 cells/microL. The initial objective of ART is to achieve an undetectable viral load. Adherence to therapy plays an essential role in maintaining the antiviral response. Therapeutic options are limited with the development of cross resistance and ART failure. Genotype studies are useful in these cases. More information regarding the studies analyzed and the panel recommendations for adherence, toxicity, treatment during pregnancy, patients with hepatitis B or C virus co-infection, and post-exposure prophylaxis can be accessed at www.gesida.seimc.org. CONCLUSIONS: CD4+ lymphocyte count is the most important reference factor for initiating ART in asymptomatic patients. The large number of available drugs, the increased sensitivity of tests to monitor viral load, and the ability to determine viral resistance is leading to a more individualized approach to therapy."
17298195,[Development and validation of laboratory methods for antiretroviral quantitation using HPLC].,"OBJECTIVE: Development, validation and error characterization of three analytical methods, by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), for the quantitative analysis of ritonavir, saquinavir and abacavir in human plasma. METHOD: Reagents and instrumentation used, preparation of different standards, sample extraction procedure from biologic matrix, and analytical conditions assayed were detailed to set up three analytical methods. In addition, the validation and the determination of analytical error were also described. RESULTS: The analytical methods developed for ritonavir, saquinavir and abacavir in human plasma were selective, linear (r2>0.99), precise (coefficients of variation<15%) and accurate (relative errors<15%) over the concentration range selected. The recovery was more than 95% in all methods. Antiretroviral drugs were stable in the storage conditions assayed according to the routine laboratory. The error function discriminated for each analytical method validated was linear in saquinavir (SD=4.84+7.14.10(-2)C) and abacavir (SD=-1.072+3.70.10(-2)C), and non-linear in ritonavir (SD=39.98+2.40.10(-5)C2). CONCLUSIONS: Three analytical methods were developed and subsequently validated, with validation parameters being within the specifications and attributes of quality established. The error function characterized for each validated method can be used as a heteroscedastic weighting method in the parameter estimation by non-linear regression analysis in clinical pharmacokinetic studies of antiretroviral drugs assayed."
17304157,Integration of atazanavir into an existing liquid chromatography UV method for protease inhibitors: validation and application.,"Atazanavir (ATV) is a widely used human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 protease inhibitor (PI) that, like other approved PIs, has been considered as a candidate for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). To provide ATV assay results that can be applied to patient management through TDM, the assay would need to perform in a manner consistent with Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) standards. To quantitate ATV concentrations in human plasma, the authors added ATV to a previously published reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method from their laboratory. Detection was effected with use of a photodiode-array detector (PDA) collecting spectra at 248 nm. This method allows for detection of ATV to a lower limit of quantitation of 0.05 microg/mL, with an intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV%) of 8.9% or less over 5 days of testing and an interassay CV% ranging from 1.4 to 6.4%. The assay has met passing requirements for interlaboratory proficiency testing for 2 years nationally and internationally, with accuracy within +/-15% over all test samples. During 2 years, more than 100 batches of analyses have been performed and have proved the method is rugged, specific, and accurate. This assay method is currently used in the authors' clinical research program in TDM."
17304158,Nevirapine concentration in nonstimulated saliva: an alternative to plasma sampling in children with human immunodeficiency virus infection.,"BACKGROUND: The monitoring of nevirapine (NVP) concentrations in pediatric patients has gained interest since the introduction of NVP as part of the preferred first-line antiretroviral regimen for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected children in resource-limited settings. Adequate trough concentrations of NVP predict successful therapy, whereas subtherapeutic levels are correlated with virologic failure and development of resistance. The aim of this study was to determine the extent of agreement between total and free plasma NVP concentrations and nonstimulated saliva NVP concentrations and to evaluate the feasibility of saliva sampling as an alternative tool for therapeutic drug monitoring of NVP in children. DESIGN AND METHODS: The study was designed as an observational cohort analysis. NVP concentrations were obtained in paired plasma and saliva samples of pediatric patients receiving antiretroviral therapy, including NVP. NVP plasma and saliva concentrations were determined by a tandem-mass spectrometric method. The intraclass correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman analysis were used to evaluate agreement and to assess pattern in any discrepancies between measurements. RESULTS: For the random paired plasma and saliva NVP sampling, 19 African-American children (8 boys, 11 girls) with a median age of 8.0 years were enrolled. Two male subjects were recruited for the 12 hour NVP plasma and saliva pharmacokinetics study. The intraclass correlations between saliva and serum measurements of NVP concentrations indicated >90% agreement between these two modes of measurement. The saliva concentrations reflected the free concentrations very closely but were on average 34% higher. The Bland-Altman plots indicated that the discrepancy between saliva and plasma measures is consistent across the range of average NVP concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Our study results strongly indicate agreement between saliva and plasma NVP concentrations in pediatric patients with HIV infection, on the basis of Bland-Altman analysis. Nonstimulated NVP saliva concentrations can be used as an alternative noninvasive, reliable, cost-effective method for direct measurement of adherence and application of therapeutic drug monitoring in NVP therapy."
17306191,[Marginal structural models application to estimate the effects of antiretroviral therapy in 5 cohorts of HIV seroconverters].,"OBJECTIVES: Standard methods to evaluate population effectiveness of treatments in observational studies have important limitations to appropriately adjust for time-dependent confounders. In this paper, we describe a recently developed methodological approach, marginal structural models (MSM), and use it to estimate the effectiveness of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on AIDS or death incidence. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We analyzed all subjects followed after 1997 as part of the GEMES project (comprised by several cohorts of HIV seroconverters in Spain) and who had not used HAART before the start of follow-up. To estimate the effect of HAART on AIDS or death incidence, we estimated the parameters of a marginal structural Cox model by fitting an inverse probability weighted logistic regression model. The estimation of the weights was based on CD4 count, time since seroconversion, sex, age, transmission category and previous treatment. RESULTS: 917 eligible subjects were followed for an average of 3.4 years and we observed 139 events. 42.1% of the participants received HAART during the study. The estimated rate ratio was 1.01 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68-1.49) using a Cox model without covariates and 0.90 (95% CI, 0.61-1.32) using a Cox model with time-dependent covariates. The causal rate ratio estimated for MSM was 0.74, (95% CI, 0.49-1.12). CONCLUSIONS: The beneficial effect of HAART estimated by the MSM, but largely missed by conventional methods, is consistent with the findings of previous randomized studies. The MSM appropriately adjusted for the time-dependent covariate CD4 count, which is both a time-varying confounder and is affected by prior treatment."
17328659,Less sensitive HIV-1 enzyme immunoassay as an adjuvant method for monitoring patients receiving antiretroviral therapy.,"Viral suppression after antiretroviral therapy is monitored by determining plasma HIV-1 through viral load assays. However, such assays only provide HIV-1 replication rates at the moment samples are drawn and do not reflect any trend in viremia fluctuation preceding sample collection. The objective of this study was to correlate the optical density (OD) of the less sensitive HIV-1 enzyme immunoassay (EIA), used in the serologic testing algorithm for recent HIV seroconversion, with viral loads in a group of HIV-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy. We studied samples from 20 previously antiretroviral-naive subjects treated with the zidovudine-lamivudine combination plus indinavir for a 20-week period. Viral loads were assessed using the less sensitive HIV-1 EIA at baseline and at 4-week intervals. There was a strong correlation between lower OD and viral load after introduction of antiretroviral drugs (p < 0.01). The ODs tended to decrease in parallel with drops in viral loads and remain steady when viral loads did not change significantly. These results suggest that the less sensitive HIV-1 EIA may be used as a complementary method for monitoring the efficacy of antiretroviral therapy, with special appeal in resource-poor areas where health professionals have limited laboratory expertise."
17330787,Influence of liver fibrosis stage on plasma levels of antiretroviral drugs in HIV-infected patients with chronic hepatitis C.,"BACKGROUND: Most antiretrovirals are metabolized in the liver, and lower dosing could be advisable in patients with severe liver insufficiency. METHODS: Plasma drug levels were measured in hepatitis C virus (HCV)/human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-coinfected patients receiving nevirapine (NVP), efavirenz (EFV), lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r), or atazanavir (ATV) with or without ritonavir. Liver fibrosis was measured using elastometry. RESULTS: A total of 268 coinfected patients with compensated liver disease were analyzed. Mean plasma levels were 6.1 micro g/mL for NVP (35 patients), 2.8 micro g/mL for EFV (46 patients), 5.8 micro g/mL for LPV (56 patients), 0.4 micro g/mL for ATV (58 patients), and 0.7 micro g/mL for ATV/r (73 patients). Overall, drug levels were higher in patients with cirrhosis than in those without cirrhosis for EFV (median, 3.4 vs. 1.9 micro g/mL; P<.01) and NVP (median, 6.6 vs. 5.8 micro g/mL; P=.33). EFV plasma levels above the toxic threshold (>4 micro g/mL) were more frequent in patients with cirrhosis than in those without (31% vs. 3%; P<.001). The same trend was seen for NVP levels >8 micro g/mL (50% vs. 27%; P=.27). By contrast, plasma levels of protease inhibitors (PIs) did not differ significantly between patients with and those without cirrhosis. CONCLUSIONS: Liver clearance of nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors, particularly EFV, is impaired in patients with cirrhosis. No similar effect is seen for PIs. Assessment of liver fibrosis by noninvasive tools may identify HCV/HIV-coinfected patients who might benefit from therapeutic drug monitoring to avoid drug overexposure."
17417070,Efficacy of low-dose boosted saquinavir once daily plus nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors in pregnant HIV-1-infected women with a therapeutic drug monitoring strategy.,"The efficacy of low-dose, ritonavir-boosted saquinavir (SQV/rtv) once daily plus 2 nucleoside retrotranscriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) in pregnant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1-infected women was prospectively evaluated, ensuring a SQV minimum concentration (Cmin) >/=100 ng/mL with a therapeutic drug monitoring strategy. The primary clinical endpoint was the percentage of women with an HIV-RNA viral load (VL) of <50 copies/mL at the time of delivery. Forty-nine pregnancy episodes were included, with a median CD4 count and VL of 441/muL and 3710 copies/mL, respectively. Two patients were lost to follow-up and 1 patient discontinued treatment because of abdominal discomfort. SQV levels were in excess of the target Cmin in 43 of 46 episodes (93.4%) in which the end of pregnancy was reached on 1200/100 mg daily. The dosage was increased to 1600/100 mg in the remaining 3 episodes to achieve the target levels. By an intention-to-treat analysis, VL was undetectable at delivery in 43 episodes (87.7%; 95% confidence interval, 78.5-96.9) after a median of 18 weeks of treatment (range, 3-39). In the 3 episodes remaining, VLs of 110,400 copies/mL and no available data were observed after only 3 weeks of treatment. Mild adverse events attributable to SQV/rtv occurred in 6 of 49 pregnancies (12.2%). No cases of HIV vertical transmission were observed. The pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and tolerability of this regimen suggest that once-daily low-dose boosted SQV may be considered an appropriate option in PI-naive or limited-PI-experienced HIV-infected pregnant women. Nevertheless, therapeutic drug monitoring is advisable to maintain appropriate levels throughout pregnancy."
17457104,Steady-state lopinavir levels in third trimester of pregnancy.,"Stek and colleagues reported low lopinavir levels in the third trimester of pregnancy at standard dosing. Since their initial report in 2003, we have taken steady-state trough lopinavir levels in all pregnant women in the third trimester; the results of 26 women on a lopinavir/ritonavir regimen are reported. The median trough level was 3.66 microg/ml, range 0.25-9.97; the median HIV viral load was 49 copies/ml at delivery. All infants were HIV polymerase chain reaction negative at 3 months."
17503667,Nevirapine concentrations in HIV-infected children treated with divided fixed-dose combination antiretroviral tablets in Malawi and Zambia.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate nevirapine concentrations in African HIV-infected children receiving divided Triomune tablets (stavudine+lamivudine+nevirapine). DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: Steady-state plasma nevirapine concentrations were determined in Malawian and Zambian children aged 8 months to 18 years receiving Triomune in routine outpatient settings. Predictors from height-for-age, body mass index (BMI)-for-age, age, sex, post-dose sampling time and dose/m2/day were investigated using centre-stratified regression with backwards elimination (P<0.1). RESULTS: Of the 71 Malawian and 56 Zambian children (median age 8.4 vs 8.5 years, height-for-age -3.15 vs -1.84, respectively), only 1 (3%) of those prescribed > or =300 mg/m2/day nevirapine had subtherapeutic concentrations (<3 mg/l) compared with 22 (23%) of those prescribed <300 mg/m2/day; most children with subtherapeutic nevirapine concentrations were taking half or quarter Triomune tablets. Lower nevirapine concentrations were independently associated with lower height-for-age (indicating stunting) (0.37 mg/l per unit higher [95% confidence interval (CI): -0.003, +0.74]; P=0.05), lower prescribed dose/m2 (+0.89 mg/l per 50 mg/m2 higher [95% CI: 0.32, 1.46]; P=0.002) and higher BMI-for-age (indicating lack of wasting) (-0.42 mg/l per unit higher [95% CI: -0.80, -0.04]; P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Currently available adult fixed-dose combination tablets are not well suited to children, particularly at younger ages: Triomune 30 is preferable to Triomune 40 because of the higher dose of nevirapine relative to stavudine. Further research is required to confirm that concentrations are reduced in stunted children but increased in wasted children. Development of appropriate paediatric fixed-dose combination tablets is essential if antiretroviral therapy is to be made widely available to children in resource-limited settings."
17503744,Evolution of resistance mutations during low-level viral replication in HIV-1-infected patients treated with zidovudine/lamivudine/abacavir as a first-line regimen.,"OBJECTIVE: Long-term evaluation of viral evolution in patients who continued first-line therapy with zidovudine/lamivudine/abacavir (Trizivir [TZV]) in the presence of low-level viral replication and assessment of the impact of mutational patterns selected under TZV on viral load (VL), CD4+ T-cell count (CD4) and subsequent therapeutic options. DESIGN: Analysis of viral evolution based on genotypic resistance tests (GRT) from samples collected during non-suppressive first-line therapy with TZV. METHODS: Patients from the Frankfurt HIV cohort with at least 3 months uninterrupted first-line therapy with TZV in whom VL and CD4 measurements were performed at baseline and at follow up were identified. Criteria for virological failure (VF) were two consecutive VL >400 copies/ml. GRTs were required at baseline, VF and last visit (LV). RESULTS: Initially, 23/119 patients were classified as VF; 4/23 were lost to follow up. Median time to VF was 48 weeks. Because of the observed virological and immunological benefit, patients continued TZV for a median of 87 weeks despite detectable viraemia. Median CD4 increase and VL reduction at LV were 120 cells/mm3 and 317,100 copies/ml, respectively, compared to baseline. After 54 weeks of treatment with detectable VL, three mutational patterns were observed: Group A (n=4) characterized by M184V without further regimen-associated mutations, group B (n=9) by M184V accompanied by one to three thymidine analogue mutations (TAMs), and group C (n=6) by M184V and four to six TAMs. No virological or CD4 parameters correlated with these patterns. Group A remained unchanged, thus preserving activity of most nucleoside analogues (NA). However, in the majority of patients (groups B and C) accumulation of mutations at different rates was observed, leading to a sequential loss of NA options. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous treatment with TZV in the presence of viral replication is associated with a stepwise accumulation of resistance mutations. M184V was present in all cases, not followed by further selection of TAMs in a small, unpredictable subgroup of patients. However, in the majority of patients selection of M184V was associated with accumulation of TAMs at different rates leading to a substantial loss of active NAs, despite continuous virological and immunological benefit when compared with baseline."
17503748,A computer-based system to aid in the interpretation of plasma concentrations of antiretrovirals for therapeutic drug monitoring.,"OBJECTIVES: To develop a computer-based system for modelling and interpreting plasma antiretroviral concentrations for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). METHODS: Data were extracted from a prospective TDM study of 199 HIV-infected patients (CCTG 578). Lopinavir (LPV) and efavirenz (EFV) pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were modelled using a Bayesian method and interpreted by an expert committee of HIV specialists and pharmacologists who made TDM recommendations. These PK models and recommendations formed the knowledge base to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) system that could estimate drug exposure, interpret PK data and generate TDM recommendations. The modelled PK exposures and expert committee TDM recommendations were considered optimum and used to validate results obtained by the AI system. RESULTS: A group of patients, 67 on LPV, 46 on EFV and three on both drugs, were included in this analysis. Correlations were high for LPV and EFV estimated trough and 4 h post-dose concentrations between the Al estimates and modelled values (r > 0.79 for all comparisons; P < 0.0001). Although trough concentrations were similar, significant differences were seen for mean predicted 4 h concentrations for EFV (4.16 microg/ml versus 3.89 microg/ml; P = 0.02) and LPV (7.99 microg/ml versus 8.79 microg/ml; P < 0.001). The AI and expert committee TDM recommendations agreed in 53 out of 69 LPV cases [kappa (kappa) = 0.53; P < 0.001] and 47 out of 49 EFV cases (kappa = 0.91; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The AI system successfully estimated LPV and EFV trough concentrations and achieved good agreement with expert committee TDM recommendations for EFV- and LPV-treated patients."
17503751,Conservation of first-line antiretroviral treatment regimen where therapeutic options are limited.,"OBJECTIVES: To determine rates and causes of switching from first- to second-line antiretroviral treatment (ART) regimens in a large treatment-naive cohort (a South African community-based ART service) where a targeted adherence intervention was used to manage initial virological breakthrough. METHODS: ART-naive adults (n=929) commencing first-line non-nucleoside-based ART [according to WHO (2002) guidelines] between September 2002 and August 2005 were studied prospectively. Viral load (VL) and CD4+ T-cell counts were monitored every 4 months. All drug switches were recorded. Counsellor-driven adherence interventions were targeted to patients with a VL > 1000 copies/ml at any visit (virological breakthrough) and the VL measurement was repeated within 8 weeks. Two consecutive VL measurements > 1000 copies/ml was considered virological failure, triggering change to a second-line regimen. RESULTS: During 760 person-years of observation [median (IQR) 189 (85-441) days], 823 (89%) patients were retained on ART, 2% transferred elsewhere, 7% died and 3% were lost to follow-up. A total of 893 (96%) patients remained on first-line therapy and 16 (1.7%) switched to second-line due to hypersensitivity reactions (n=9) or lactic acidosis (n=7). A Kaplan-Meier estimate for switching to second-line due to toxicity was 3.0% at 32 months. Virological breakthrough occurred in 67 (7.2%) patients, but, following use of a targeted adherence intervention, virological failure was confirmed in just 20 (2.2%). Kaplan-Meier estimates at 32 months were 20% for virological breakthrough but only 5.6% for confirmed virological failure. CONCLUSION: Regimen switches were due to virological failure or toxicity. Although follow-up time was limited, over 95% of individuals remained on first-line ART using a combination of viral monitoring and a targeted adherence intervention."
17529895,Limited-sampling strategy for the prediction of boosted hard-gel saquinavir exposure at a dosage of 1000/100 mg twice daily in human immunodeficiency virus-infected individuals.,"Area under the concentration time curve (AUC) over a dosing interval is considered to be the best estimate of drug exposure in a patient. However, determination of this parameter is costly and often impractical, requiring multiple samples and a great deal of time and resources. A limited-sampling strategy (LSS) may overcome some of these issues, making pharmacokinetic studies easier to perform, particularly in a limited-resource setting. The aim of this work was to develop and validate a pragmatic LSS for the accurate and precise prediction of boosted saquinavir AUC0-12 (AUC over the 12-hour dosing interval) at a dosage of 1000/100 mg twice daily. Pharmacokinetic data were obtained from 34 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals stable on saquinavir/ritonavir-containing therapy, randomly split into two sets (n = 17 per set). One set was used to construct prediction models using univariate and multivariate analysis (development set), and the second was used to determine the predictive performance of the models (validation set). For single samples, 6- and 10-hour concentrations correlated best with saquinavir AUC0-12 (r2: 0.913 and 0.911, respectively), yet all single samples failed to produce precise and unbiased predictions. However, combinations at 2, 6; 0, 2, 6; 0, 4, 10; 0, 4, 12; and 2, 4, 6 hours achieved good predictive performances, and both precise [root mean squared relative prediction error (%RMSE): 6.4% to 11.9%] and unbiased [mean relative prediction error (%MPE), 95% CI: -2.7%, (-0.8)-2.7 to 1.6%, (-1.8)-4.7] estimations of saquinavir AUC0-12. Of these models, concentrations obtained at 0, 2, 6 and 2, 4, 6 hours are more practical in a clinical setting and are therefore the LSS with most potential. Provided that the technique is validated in specific patient populations, an LSS approach is a potentially useful tool to evaluate the AUC0-12 of saquinavir in resource-limited settings, reducing both costs and volumes of blood taken. It may also aid the choice of sampling times for population analysis."
17558333,"Adherence to antiretroviral therapy in patients receiving free treatment from a government hospital in Blantyre, Malawi.","OBJECTIVES: To compare 3 measures of adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in HIV-positive adults receiving free treatment from a public hospital in Malawi. METHODS: Adherence was measured over 1 month by pill count (PC), self-report, and a medication event monitoring system RESULTS: Data from 80 patients were available for analysis. The mean patient age was 38.6 years, and 57.5% were female. The mean adherence using the MEMS cap (MC) was 88.1%. Forty-six (57.5%) patients had MC adherence > or =95%, and 13 (16.2%) had <80% adherence. There was no association between MC adherence and time on ART. Mean PC adherence was 98.6%, significantly higher than MC adherence (P < 0.001). There was no clear relation between PC and MC adherence: 4 patients had MC adherence <20% but PC adherence of 100%. Self-reports of missing a tablet did not correlate with poor MC adherence. CONCLUSIONS: The study shows the complexities of measuring adherence and probable overestimation of adherence by PC and self-report. Because these are the main methods used in developing countries, this raises concerns about the development of drug resistance. Improved methods are needed to detect nonadherence in developing countries, and validation of MC data with drug levels and virologic outcome in this setting is important."
17570302,New insights into HIV resistance testing: nursing guidelines and implications.,"The detection of resistance by HIV drug resistance assays has become an important management tool for use in the HIV-infected patient. Because of its important role in management of HIV disease, it is important for the nurse to understand the mechanism of HIV resistance, the appropriate use of resistance tests, and how to use this information to improve or maximize patient outcomes. The purpose of this review is to increase the nurse's awareness of the problem of resistance, to describe the available resistance tests, and to develop a model whereby the patient collaborates with the health care team in understanding, implementing, and monitoring resistance-related actions."
17577653,Optimal recall period and response task for self-reported HIV medication adherence.,"Self-reported measures of antiretroviral adherence vary greatly in recall time periods and response tasks. To determine which time frame is most accurate, we compared 3-, 7-day, and 1-month self-reports with data from medication event monitoring system (MEMS). To determine which response task is most accurate we compared three different 1-month self-report tasks (frequency, percent, and rating) to MEMS. We analyzed 643 study visits made by 156 participants. Over-reporting (self-report minus MEMS) was significantly less for the 1-month recall period (9%) than for the 3 (17%) or 7-day (14%) periods. Over-reporting was significantly less for the 1-month rating task (3%) than for the 1-month frequency and percent tasks (both 12%). We conclude that 1-month recall periods may be more accurate than 3- or 7-day periods, and that items that ask respondents to rate their adherence may be more accurate than those that ask about frequencies or percents."
17582235,Simultaneous determination of 17 antiretroviral drugs in human plasma for quantitative analysis with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.,"This work describes a sensitive method for the simultaneous determination of 17 antiretroviral drugs including nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors, non-nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors, protease inhibitors and a nucleotide analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor in 50 microL of human plasma. This method employed high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization. The analytes were monitored in multiple reaction monitoring mode and the polarity was switched from positive to negative to positive to detect all compounds after a single injection. A combination of liquid-liquid extraction and protein precipitation was used to extract all compounds, with at least 75% recovery for all analytes. Within- and between-day accuracies were at least 85% for 1-500 ng/mL for nelfinavir, indinavir and abacavir, 10-500 ng/mL for didanosine and stavudine and 5-500 ng/mL for all other compounds. This method is very effective for quantifying and screening antiretroviral drugs in clinical samples with limited (50 microL) volumes."
17597142,Development and evaluation of an immunoassay for the monitoring of the anti-HIV drug amprenavir.,"An assay for routine therapeutic drug monitoring of anti-HIV HAART drugs in clinical use is highly desirable, in order to rapidly measure the pharmacokinetic parameters on single patients. We have started a project to develop a panel of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) for the whole set of HAART drugs, and the development, performance and evaluation of the assay for amprenavir is described here. A diazo conjugate of amprenavir has been used in order to raise polyclonal anti-amprenavir antibodies in rabbits. Antisera have been used to set up a quantitative and rapid competitive assay. Plasma samples are simply diluted in the assay buffer after thermal inactivation, before running the assay. The assay allows the detection of amprenavir in the quantification range 400-5000 ng/ml, in a diluted plasma sample. The assay has been compared with an HPLC reference technique, on 27 samples from treated patients. Within the quantification range, the ELISA data are well correlated with the HPLC results by a regression line close to the identity, and a Bland-Altman analysis shows the agreement between the two methods."
17606683,Immunochromatographic strip test for rapid detection of nevirapine in plasma samples from human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients.,"We report a novel one-step immunochromatographic strip test for the rapid, qualitative detection of nevirapine in plasma samples from human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients. The sensitivity was 100% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 97.8 to 100%), and the specificity was 99.5% (95% CI, 97.2 to 99.9%). The limit of detection was 25 ng/ml. Immunochromatographic strip tests are simple, rapid, and cheap assays that could greatly facilitate drug level monitoring in resource-limited settings."
17610214,Fast and simultaneous determination of darunavir and eleven other antiretroviral drugs for therapeutic drug monitoring: method development and validation for the determination of all currently approved HIV protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors in human plasma by liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry.,"For the quantification of all currently approved non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors, including the new protease inhibitor darunavir and the active nelfinavir metabolite M8, an assay was developed, using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. The sample pretreatment consisted of a protein precipitation with a mixture of methanol and acetonitrile using only 100 microL plasma. Chromatographic separation was performed on a reversed-phase C18 column (150 x 2.0 mm, particle size 5 microm) with a quick stepwise gradient using an acetate buffer (pH 5) and methanol, at a flow rate of 0.25 mL/min. The analytical run time was only 10 min. The triple quadrupole mass spectrometer was operated in the positive ion mode and multiple reaction monitoring was used for drug quantification. The method was validated over a range of 0.1 to 20 microg/mL for amprenavir, atazanavir, efavirenz, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, the active nelfinavir metabolite M8, nevirapine and ritonavir, a range of 0.05 to 10 microg/mL for saquinavir and darunavir and a range of 0.5 to 100 microg/mL for tipranavir, based on observed concentration ranges in patients treated with these drugs. D5-squinavir, D6-indinavir, 13C6-efavirenz and dibenzepine were used as internal standards. The method was proven to be specific, accurate, precise and robust. Accuracies ranged from 88.5% to 102.2% and all precisions were less than 9.5%. Furthermore, the assay demonstrates a high sensitivity for all analytes and the stepwise gradient allows addition of new analytes into the same method. The method is now successfully applied for routine therapeutic drug monitoring and pharmacokinetic studies in HIV-infected patients."
17630564,"Electrocardiographic changes in HIV-infected, drug-experienced patients being treated with atazanavir.","The QRS interval of 56 out of 75 (74.7%) HIV-infected, drug-experienced patients (66.7% men) increased during treatment with boosted or unboosted atazanavir by a median 5 ms (interquartile range 0-9; P < 0.0001); the PR and the QTc intervals did not change significantly. New asymptomatic bundle branch blocks were observed in four patients; one subject with a baseline first-degree atrioventricular block developed symptomatic bradyarrhythmia while receiving atenolol. The electrocardiographic monitoring of patients treated with atazanavir seems advisable."
17665183,Tenofovir comedication does not impair the steady-state pharmacokinetics of ritonavir-boosted atazanavir in HIV-1-infected adults.,"OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate the steady-state pharmacokinetics of ritonavir-boosted atazanavir when coadministered with tenofovir in HIV-1-infected adult patients. DESIGN: Forty adult HIV-1-infected patients received either atazanavir/ritonavir 300/100 mg once daily and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors with (n = 20) or without (n = 20) tenofovir-disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir-DF) 300 mg once daily. Twenty-four-hour pharmacokinetics were assessed after at least 2 weeks of therapy according to a standardised therapeutic drug monitoring protocol. METHODS: Atazanavir/ritonavir plasma concentrations were measured by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, and the geometric means of minimum and maximum concentrations (C(min), C(max)), the area under the time-concentration curve (AUC), half-life (t(1/2)) and total clearance (CL(tot)) were subject to a matched pairs-analysis. Patients' pairs were matched for gender, ethnicity, weight and Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) status. RESULTS: The respective geometric means (90% CI) for atazanavir C(min), C(max) and AUC with tenfovir vs. without tenofovir were 405 (314-523) vs. 417 (304-572) ng/ml, 3,022 (2,493-3,664) vs. 2,817 (2,341-3,390) ng/ml and 34,822 (29,315-41,363) vs. 32,101 (26,206-39,321) ng x h/ml showing no significant differences between the groups. Atazanavir plasma concentrations measured at week 5 of therapy or later were lower than in the first 4 weeks (T-test for C(max), p = .080; AUC, p = .050 and CL(tot), p = .051). CONCLUSIONS: The coadministration of tenofovir-DF did not impair the plasma concentrations of ritonavir-boosted atazanavir in a pharmacokinetic analysis of patient pairs matched for gender, ethnicity, weight and CDC status."
17690876,Maintenance of indinavir by dose adjustment in HIV-1-infected patients with indinavir-related toxicity.,"OBJECTIVE: Treatment with indinavir/ritonavir (IDV/RTV) is very effective but hampered by frequent development of IDV-associated adverse events (mainly nephrotoxicity and skin changes). We tested whether dose reduction of IDV guided by therapeutic drug monitoring resulted in improved tolerability without compromising antiviral efficacy. PATIENTS: HIV-infected patients with any IDV/RTV regimen who suffer from IDV-related adverse events were included. Viral load had to be adequately controlled for at least 2 months prior to inclusion. Dose reduction from 800 mg to 600 or 400 mg IDV b.i.d. followed a specified protocol. IDV-related toxicity and IDV plasma concentrations were monitored for 24 weeks. IDV concentrations were quantified with a validated high performance liquid chromatography method. RESULTS: Twenty patients were included. Reasons for inclusion were: skin abnormalities 11, nephrotoxicity five, metabolic disturbances three, and hypertension one. IDV dose could be lowered to 400 mg b.i.d. in 13, to 600 mg b.i.d. in two patients. Five patients discontinued the treatment. Overall tolerability improved with respect to incidence and severity of adverse events. Median trough concentrations decreased from 1.02 mg/l (range 0.08-7.1) at baseline to 0.48 mg/l (0.11-1.4) after 24 weeks (p = 0.03) and remained above the critical threshold of 0.1 mg/l at any time after dose reduction. There was no change of CD4 cell counts or viral suppression. There were no significant changes in other laboratory parameters (creatinine, bilirubin, triglycerides, cholesterol, blood count, and urinalysis). CONCLUSION: Dose reduction of IDV improved tolerability of IDV-containing highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART). Sufficient IDV trough concentrations were maintained in all patients as was virologic control."
17704117,Therapeutic drug monitoring of the HIV protease inhibitor atazanavir in clinical practice.,"BACKGROUND: Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is being applied for a number of antiretroviral agents. Little is known about the use of TDM for atazanavir. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort analysis on the use of TDM of atazanavir at three clinical sites in The Netherlands. Patients were divided into three groups: (i) all patients with evaluable data of plasma atazanavir concentrations and its relationship with hyperbilirubinaemia; (ii) patients who started atazanavir without documented evidence of protease inhibitor (PI) mutations; (iii) patients who started atazanavir with documented evidence of PI mutations. The genotypic inhibitory quotient (GIQ) was calculated by dividing the mean atazanavir plasma trough concentration by the number of PI mutations. RESULTS: A total of 108 patients were included; 70 (65.8%) were using atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily). No significant relationship was observed between atazanavir plasma trough concentration and antiviral response in patients starting atazanavir without PI mutations (group 2; n = 82). In contrast, a significant relationship was observed between atazanavir GIQ and treatment response in patients starting atazanavir while having PI mutations (group 3; n = 26). The cut-off value for GIQ most predictive of virological failure was 0.23 mg/L/mutation: patients (n = 8) with a GIQ equal to or below this value had 50% virological failure whereas patients (n = 18) with a GIQ above 0.23 mg/L/mutation had only 11% virological failure (chi(2): P = 0.030). Atazanavir plasma trough concentrations were significantly related with the occurrence of increased total bilirubin concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: TDM of atazanavir might be beneficial for patients with documented PI resistance or patients with hyperbilirubinaemia."
17786128,A randomized controlled trial of therapeutic drug monitoring in treatment-naive and -experienced HIV-1-infected patients.,"OBJECTIVE: To improve the utility of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) by defining the proportion of patients with and predictors of above or below target protease inhibitor (PI) or nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) concentrations. METHODS: This 48-week, multicenter, open-label clinical trial randomized patients to TDM versus standard of care (SOC). Serial pharmacokinetics, including a week-2 3-sample sparse collection, and expert committee TDM recommendations were given to TDM-arm patients' providers. RESULTS: Seventy-four (39%) of 190 patients had week-2 concentrations outside of targets and 122 (64%) of 190 had nontarget exposure at least once over 48 weeks. Providers accepted 75% of TDM recommendations. Among patients with below-target concentrations, more TDM-arm than SOC-arm patients achieved targets (65% vs. 45%; P = 0.09). Increased body weight and efavirenz or lopinavir/ritonavir use were significant predictors of nontarget concentrations. Patients at target and patients who achieved targets after TDM-directed dose modifications trended toward greater viral load reductions at week 48 than patients with below-target exposures (HIV RNA reductions: 2.4, 2.3, and 1.9 log10 copies/mL, respectively; P = 0.09). CONCLUSIONS: Most patients had nontarget PI and/or NNRTI concentrations over 48 weeks. TDM recommendations were well accepted and improved exposure. Patients below TDM targets trended toward worse virologic response."
17802918,Evaluation of Elisa test for therapeutic monitoring of Nelfinavir in HIV-positive patients.,"Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is an important tool in the management of antiretroviral (ARV) therapy. The gold standard for measuring drugs plasma levels is High-Performance Liquid Chromatographic Assay (HPLC) however it is technically-demanding and time-consuming. We evaluated a new immunoenzymatic test (TDM-ELISA, Biostrands, Trieste, Italy) for nelfinavir and its active metabolite M8 in comparison with HPLC. A statistically significant difference in Ctrough between the two different tests was demonstrated but this difference was no longer significant when a value of 29% due to M8 aliquot was deleted. This faster TDM-ELISA may have an important role for TDM in HIV patients taking ARVs."
17882408,Adherence to HAART therapy measured by electronic monitoring in newly diagnosed HIV patients in Botswana.,"AIMS: This pilot study was designed to evaluate the feasibility and benefits of electronic adherence monitoring of antiretroviral medications in HIV patients who recently started Highly Active Anti Retroviral Therapy (HAART) in Francistown, Botswana and to compare this with self-reporting. METHODS: Dosing histories were compiled electronically using Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) monitors to evaluate adherence to prescribed therapies. Thirty patients enrolled in the antiretroviral treatment program were monitored over 6 weeks. These patients were all antiretroviral (ARV) naive. After each visit (mean three times) to the pharmacy, the data compiled by the monitors were downloaded. Electronic monitoring of adherence was compared to patient self-reports of adherence. RESULTS: The mean individual medication adherence level measured with the electronic device was 85% (range 21-100%). The mean adherence level measured by means of self-reporting was 98% (range 70-100%). Medication prescribed on a once-a-day dose base was associated with a higher adherence level (97.9% for efavirenz) compared with a twice-a-day regimen (88.4% for Lamivudine/Zidovudine). CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to assess treatment adherence of patients living in a low resource setting on HAART by using electronic monitors. Adherence, even in the early stages of treatment, appears to be insufficient in some patients and may be below the level required for continuous inhibition of viral replication. This approach may lead to improved targeting of counselling about their medication intake of such patients in order to prevent occurrence of resistant viral strains due to inadequate inhibition of viral replication. In this pilot study a significant difference between the data recorded through the electronic monitors and those provided by self-reporting was observed."
17898644,Assessing the impact of substance use and hepatitis coinfection on atazanavir and lopinavir trough concentrations in HIV-infected patients during therapeutic drug monitoring.,"Atazanavir (ATV) and lopinavir (LPV) are widely used HIV-1 protease inhibitors. Like with other protease inhibitors, careful monitoring of potential drug-drug and drug-disease interactions in clinical practice is necessary. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of substance use and hepatitis virus coinfection on plasma ATV and LPV trough concentrations in HIV-positive substance users and nonusers. Individuals established on ATV (300 mg and 100 mg ritonavir daily) or LPV (400 mg and 100 mg ritonavir twice daily)-containing regimens completed two clinical visits (trough and directly observed therapy) during which dosing characteristics, concomitant medication, and substance use were recorded. Trough plasma concentrations (22-26 hours for ATV and 10-14 hours for LPV) were measured using LCMSMS. The influence of substance use was evaluated by Kruskal-Wallis test. Substance use was associated with a marked decrease in trough LPV concentrations during the trough visit (median, 5.536 and 3.791 microg/mL for nonsubstance users and substance users, respectively, P = 0.029). Significantly lower LPV trough levels were also noted among patients with active hepatitis C virus coinfection evaluated as an independent variable (median, 2.253 and 5.927 microg/mL for active and inactive/no hepatitis C virus infection, respectively, P = 0.032). Substance use and hepatitis virus coinfection had limited effects on ATV trough levels. In this cohort, despite the wide interindividual variability of ATV and LPV trough concentrations, significant associations between substance use and active hepatitis C virus infection and low LPV trough concentrations were observed. Further work is needed to assess the optimal dosing regimen when using LPV in HIV-infected substance users."
17898658,Monitoring atazanavir concentrations with boosted or unboosted regimens in HIV-infected patients in routine clinical practice.,"Although atazanavir pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are related, the atazanavir plasma trough concentrations of patients on regimens that are not boosted by low doses of ritonavir may not be high enough to maintain viral suppression. In this cross-sectional study, the percentage of patients with atazanavir trough concentrations lower than the proposed minimum effective concentration was compared between HIV-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy with ritonavir-boosted (ATV/r, n = 31) or unboosted (ATV, n = 54) atazanavir in clinical practice. Blood samples were drawn 21 to 25 hours after the last atazanavir dose. Drug concentrations in plasma were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography and considered suboptimal if they were lower than 0.15 mg/L or potentially toxic if higher than 0.85 mg/L. The median (interquartile range) atazanavir concentration was 0.711 (0.394-0.914) mg/L in patients receiving ATV/r and 0.121 (0.052-0.209) mg/L in patients receiving ATV (P < 0.001). None of the patients receiving ATV/r and 62.9% of the subjects receiving ATV showed drug concentrations below 0.15 mg/L (odds ratio, 2.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.9-3.8; P < 0.001). In contrast, atazanavir concentrations were higher than 0.85 mg/L in 32.2% of the patients receiving ATV/r compared with 3.7% of the subjects receiving ATV (odds ratio, 8.7; 95% confidence interval, 2.0-37.2; P = 0.001). Atazanavir and total bilirubin concentrations in plasma were correlated. In conclusion, atazanavir trough concentrations may be lower than the proposed minimum effective concentration in a considerable percentage of HIV-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy with unboosted atazanavir. Therapeutic drug monitoring may be useful in this setting."
17898659,Effect of anticoagulants on plasma nevirapine and efavirenz concentrations.,"Antiretroviral drug measurements as part of therapeutic drug monitoring are performed in several human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) clinics in developed as well as developing countries. Heparin is routinely used as an anticoagulant for plasma drug estimations. EDTA plasma for drug estimations, if found suitable, would have several practical advantages. In this study, plasma nevirapine (NVP) and efavirenz (EFV) levels were compared in paired blood collected in heparin and EDTA Vacutainer tubes (Greiner Bio-one, Austria). The study involved HIV-infected individuals who were receiving antiretroviral treatment at the Government Hospital of Thoracic Medicine, Tambaram, Chennai, India. Their treatment consisted of administration of NVP or EFV, along with lamivudine and stavudine/zidovudine. Blood was collected at the same time in heparin and EDTA Vacutainer tubes. Plasma concentrations of NVP and EFV were estimated, according to validated methods, by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The mean NVP concentrations in heparin and EDTA plasma were 8.79 and 8.59 microg/mL, respectively. This difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.203). In the case of EFV, the corresponding values were 3.03 and 2.78 microg/mL, respectively; the difference was significant (P < 0.05). However, the percent variation in EFV between both types of plasma was <10%. Blood collected in heparin or EDTA Vacutainer tubes could be used for plasma NVP determination."
17917268,The validation of plasma darunavir concentrations determined by the HPLC method for protease inhibitors.,"Darunavir (DRV) is a new protease inhibitor used to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type-1. The aim of this study was to validate the determination of plasma DRV concentrations using the HPLC method, a simple procedure for simultaneous determination of seven HIV protease inhibitors and efavirenz. The calibration curve was linear (range of 0.13 to 10.36 microg/ml). The average accuracy ranged from 100.7 to 105.6%. Both the interday and intraday coefficients of variation were less than 6.7%, which was similar to or much lower than previously reported values by the LC/MS/MS method. It is concluded that HPLC can be used to determine plasma DRV concentrations and routinely in the clinical setting; thus, this HPLC method enables further study of DRV pharmacokinetics in conventional hospital laboratories."
17933700,Comparison of indinavir + ritonavir 600 + 100 mg vs. 400 + 100 mg BID combinations in HIV1-infected patients guided by therapeutic drug monitoring.,"OBJECTIVE: To compare two reduced dose indinavir (IDV) + ritonavir (RTV) combinations guided by therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) in treatment-naive HIV1-infected patients. METHODS: HIV1-infected treatment naive patients were prospectively randomized to treatment with IDV 600 mg or 400 mg BID each in combination with RTV 100 mg BID. Boosted IDV was combined with 2 NRTI, and patients were followed for 48 weeks. IDV-trough levels and initially also peak levels (C2h) were performed to allow dose modification of IDV following a specified protocol. RESULTS: 14 patients were randomized (age 38 +/- 10.4 years; mean +/- SD; 3 female, 11 male). 8 were treated with 600 mg (group 1), 6 with 400 mg IDV BID (group 2). Efficacy of treatment was good: CD4-cell count increased from 198/microl (14-523; median, range) to 371/microl (214-927) after 48 weeks (p<0.01). All but one patient with adherence problems achieved a viral load below the limit of detection. At the beginning two patients had plasma levels below 0.1 mg/l, most likely due to adherence problems. However, in the course of the observation period all patients had adequate plasma levels. 3 patients in group 1 could further reduce their IDV dose to 400 mg BID due to high plasma (peak and trough) levels. Rate of discontinuation was high (1: 4 pat., 2: 2 pat.), but only one discontinuation was possibly associated with IDV (alopecia; group 2). There were no significant changes in laboratory parameters (bilirubin, triglycerides, cholesterol) or suspicious urine results. Incidence and severity of adverse events was lower than in previous studies. CONCLUSION: Despite the low number of patients it seems reasonable to state, that boosted IDV may be used in significantly reduced dose. Efficacy seemed not to be altered, whereas tolerability was improved."
17933708,Efavirenz-therapy in HIV-patients with underlying liver disease: importance of continuous TDM of EFV.,"OBJECTIVE: Many HIV-patients have a chronic liver disease due to HBV-/HCV-coinfections and/or consume of alcohol. In these patients therapy with EFV is often problematic because of NNRTI associated liver toxicity. Measurement of EFV plasmalevels and dose adjustment using TDM should be evaluated in this study. METHODS: EFV-plasmasamples were standardized drawn 12h after ingestion. Measurement of 576 EFV plasmalevels was performed by HPLC. EFV plasmalevels as well as ALT-, AST- and GGT-values of 64 patients treated with EFV (5206 weeks) were measured regularly. 16 patients had a HCV-coinfection, 3 had a HBV-coinfection and 5 had an concomitant alcoholic liver disease. Maximal changes of ALT-, AST- and GGT-values (DeltaALT, DeltaAST, DeltaGGT), CD4-/CD8 cells and HIV-RNA were registered during therapy. Dose adjustment was performed for EFV plasmalevels out of target range 1000-4000 ng/ml. RESULTS: EFV plasmalevels of 40 HIV-patients (2288 +/- 1199 ng/ml) showed no significant differences compared to plasmalevels of HIV/HCV-patients (2391 +/- 976 ng/ml) or to plasmalevels of HIV/HBV-patients (1913 +/- 288 ng/ml) or to those of HIV-patients with alcoholic liver disease (1702 +/- 506 ng/ml). In 24 HIV-patients with underlying liver disease median DeltaGGT was +25 IU/l, median DALT was +13 IU/l and median DeltaAST was +8 IU/l. Dose adjustment was performed in 1 patient during study period. Increasing rates of ALT-, AST- and GGT-values showed no significant differences between liver healthy HIV-patients and those with a liver disease. 44 patients with continuous EFV plasmalevels in target range reached a viral suppression <100 c/ml during therapy. CONCLUSIONS: EFV-plasmalevels of HIV-infected patients showed no significant differences compared to EFV-plasmalevels of coinfected patients with concomitant liver disease. In those patients DeltaALT, DeltaAST and DeltaGGT were not significantly different than in liver-healthy HIV-patients with normal EFV-plasmaconcentrations. EFV plasmalevels in target range of 1000-4000 ng/ml correlate to a good viral response. One patient after dose adjustment was able to continue therapy. Using TDM EFV therapy in patients with underlying liver disease is save."
18001255,Drug interactions in the management of HIV infection: an update.,"Improvement in the availability of antiretroviral (ARV) therapy continues to reduce HIV morbidity and mortality. With more treatment choices and better accessibility, the extent of medication use among patients with HIV/AIDS continues to grow. ARV drugs are particularly prone to drug interactions as a consequence of their metabolic and pharmacokinetic properties. The recognition and management of drug interactions in patients on ARVs is a constant challenge to medical providers. Staying abreast of drug interaction knowledge is complicated by the rate at which new information becomes available through in vivo investigation, case reports and pharmacokinetic studies. In addition, distinguishing the clinical significance of an interaction is difficult due to the large interpatient variability in pharmacokinetics exhibited by most ARV agents. This review provides an update to a previous review article published in 2005, and is intended to improve the reader's knowledge of drug interactions in the management of HIV infection."
18025877,Atazanavir plus low-dose ritonavir in pregnancy: pharmacokinetics and placental transfer.,"BACKGROUND: Adequate antiretroviral exposure during pregnancy is critical to prevent the vertical transmission of HIV and for maternal health. Pregnancy can alter drug kinetics. We assessed the pharmacokinetics of atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg a day) during pregnancy. METHODS: An intensive steady-state 24-h pharmacokinetic profile of atazanavir was performed in the third trimester of pregnancy and postpartum. Maternal and umbilical cord blood samples were obtained at delivery. We measured atazanavir by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Seventeen women completed the study. Antepartum, the atazanavir geometric mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h (AUC0-24) was 28 510 ng.h/l, the maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) was 2 591 ng/ml and the 24-h postdose concentration (Ctrough) was 486 ng/ml. The same postpartum parameters were 30 465 ng.h/l, 2 878 ng/ml and 514 ng/ml, respectively. The antepartum to postpartum ratio for AUC0-24 was 0.94 and for Ctrough was 0.96, indicating equivalence, whereas Cmax values were slightly although not significantly lower. The ratio of cord blood/maternal atazanavir concentration in 14 paired samples was 0.13. CONCLUSION: Atazanavir exposure during the third trimester of pregnancy is similar to that observed in the non-pregnant period. Over the whole dosing interval, therapeutic drug concentrations well above the wild-type HIV 90% inhibitory concentration are maintained. Atazanavir crosses the placenta, potentially providing further protection for the newborn. As pregnancy does not appear to alter atazanavir exposure, no dose adjustment is required in pregnant women. Results suggest that atazanavir is a reasonable component of HAART during pregnancy."
18043478,Pharmacokinetic interaction between darunavir and saquinavir in HIV-negative volunteers.,"This was an open-label, crossover study to investigate the pharmacokinetic interaction between darunavir (TMC114), coadministered with low-dose ritonavir (darunavir/ritonavir), and the protease inhibitor saquinavir in HIV-negative healthy volunteers. Thirty-two volunteers were randomized into two cohorts (panel 1 and panel 2). In two separate sessions, panel 1 received 400/100 mg darunavir/ritonavir twice a day and 400/1000/100 mg darunavir/saquinavir/ritonavir twice a day; panel 2 received 1000/100 mg saquinavir/ritonavir twice a day and 400/1000/100 mg darunavir/saquinavir/ritonavir twice a day. All treatments were administered orally under fed conditions for 13 days with an additional single morning dose on day 14. Treatment sessions were separated by a washout period of at least 14 days. Twenty-six volunteers completed the study (n=14, panel 1; n=12, panel 2), whereas six discontinued as a result of adverse events. Coadministration of saquinavir with darunavir/ritonavir resulted in decreases of darunavir area under the curve and maximum and minimum plasma concentrations of 26%, 17%, and 42%, respectively, compared with administration of darunavir/ritonavir alone. Relative to treatment with saquinavir/ritonavir alone, saquinavir exposure was not significantly different with the addition of darunavir. Ritonavir area under the curve12h increased by 34% when saquinavir was added to treatment with darunavir/ritonavir. The coadministration of darunavir/saquinavir/ritonavir was generally well tolerated. Similar findings are expected with the approved 600/100 mg darunavir/ritonavir twice-a-day dose. The combination of saquinavir and darunavir/ritonavir is currently not recommended."
18058416,Factors associated with altered pharmacokinetics in substance users and non-substance users receiving lopinavir and atazanavir.,"Substance use is highly prevalent in HIV-infected individuals in the United States, and clinical management is complicated by the need for antiretroviral treatment, addiction therapy, variable medication adherence, and co-morbidities. The interrelation between HIV and substance use prompted our investigation to examine substance use and self-reported medication adherence in patients receiving the HIV-1 protease inhibitors, atazanavir (ATV) or lopinavir (LPV). ATV and LPV pharmacokinetics were determined by measuring plasma concentrations in subjects with active substance use (SU group) or with no active substance use (NSU group). No difference in adherence was observed between groups (p > 0.05). The mean SU ATV trough was 0.550+/-0.45 microg/mL; the mean NSU ATV trough was 0.780+/-0.590 microg/mL (p > 0.05). The mean SU LPV trough was 4.02+/-2.39 microg/mL; the mean NSU LPV trough was 6.67+/-0.910 microg/mL (p = 0.01). Co-factors found to be associated with variation in ATV and LPV concentrations included concurrent methadone use, cigarette smoking, and substance use status. These data indicate that chronic HIV treatment may be assisted with plasma concentration monitoring to identify those patients who may require dosage modification and/or regimen adjustment in order to optimize antiretroviral effects."

18177434,Measurement of CD4+ T cells in point-of-care settings with the Sysmex pocH-100i haematological analyser.,"The decision to provide antiretroviral therapy to HIV-positive patients mainly depends on the CD4(+) T-cell count, with therapy indicated at a cut-off value of <350-200 CD4(+) T cells/microl blood. Monitoring patients is still a major problem in countries with limited resources where blood samples often have to be transported over long distances to regional referral centres in which the count can be performed on flow cytometers. We have evaluated a newly developed simple and inexpensive method for CD4(+) T-cell quantification. It is a variation of the Invitrogen T4 Quant kit, with manual isolation of nuclei from CD4(+) T cells and subsequent counting on the small haematology analyser pocH-100i, Sysmex. We have demonstrated that this new method is highly reproducible and gives stable and linear results over a wide range of CD4(+) T-cell concentrations. Method comparison to two different flow cytometers showed excellent correlation with concordances of about 93%. Overall, this method is rapid, easy to perform and offers a good reliable alternative to measurement by flow cytometry. The pocH-100i has the additional benefit of providing a complete blood count with a three-part white blood cell differential and software for patient data storage and handling."

18215983,"The design and implementation of A5146, a prospective trial assessing the utility of therapeutic drug monitoring using an inhibitory quotient in antiretroviral-experienced HIV-infected patients.","The AIDS Clinical Trials Group designed and implemented a prospective, randomized, strategy trial in antiretroviral-experienced, HIV-infected patients to evaluate the virologic impact of protease inhibitor dose escalation in response to therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) with an inhibitory quotient, which integrates both drug exposure and viral drug resistance. In the process of developing this clinical trial, several unique challenges were identified that required innovative solutions. The major challenge was the need to integrate resistance testing, pharmacokinetic data, medication adherence, toxicity data, clinical assessments, randomization assignment, and protocol-specified clinical management in a way that could be utilized in real time by the protocol team, communicated promptly to the clinical sites, and transmitted accurately to the study database. In addition, the protocol team had to address the relative lack of commercially available TDM laboratories in the United States that were experienced in antiretroviral drug assays and a lack of familiarity with the principles of pharmacokinetic monitoring at participating clinical sites. This article outlines the rationale for the design of this strategy trial, specific barriers to implementation that were identified, and solutions that were developed with the hope that these experiences will facilitate the design and conduct of future trials of TDM."
18223464,Intra-individual variability in efavirenz plasma concentrations supports therapeutic drug monitoring based on quarterly sampling in the first year of therapy.,"Intrapatient variability in drug plasma concentrations is critical to the use of therapeutic drug monitoring with efavirenz, a non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor. Marked intrapatient variability, particularly for concentrations near the minimal therapeutic concentration, could be a predictor of virologic failure, meaning that a single concentration is of limited value. Previous reports on efavirenz intra-individual variability were obtained only in follow-up periods of 3 to 12 months and do not provide a rationale for the periodicity of sample measurements needed in long-term therapy to identify patients with a large variability and increased risk of therapeutic failure. The aim of this work was to investigate intra-individual variability in efavirenz plasma concentrations over a long-term follow-up period to support therapeutic drug monitoring. In a case series study, clinical and laboratory data were collected from all HIV-positive adults at the immunodeficiency outpatient clinic who were on regimens containing efavirenz in 2002 and who gave their informed consent (n = 31). Efavirenz plasma concentrations were measured throughout a 3 year period, without dose adjustments. For each patient, 6 to 12 samples were obtained over the follow-up period with an interval of at least 3 months between each sample. Mean plasma concentrations (mg/L) in the first, second, and third year of follow-up were 2.20 +/- 0.64, 2.17 +/- 0.68, and 2.31 +/- 0.57. Mean intra-individual variability throughout the first, second, and third year of study was 27%, 31%, and 25%, ranging from 12% to 63%. No differences in intrapatient variability in efavirenz plasma concentrations were found between females and males, HBV/HCV and HBV/HCV patients, or age above/below 40 years. Mean values (intra-individual variability) in plasma concentrations (mg/L) found in 3 of 31 patients who experienced virologic failure were 1.78 (42%), 1.52 (16%), and 1.68 (45%). The high interindividual variability and low maintained values of intrapatient variability in plasma concentrations support therapeutic drug monitoring, which could be based on measurements taken quarterly during the first year of therapeutics. In patients presenting high values of intra-individual variability (eg, >40%) associated with low plasma concentrations (eg, <2 mg/L), more frequent measurements over longer periods (more than 1 yr) of controlled concentrations might be recommended, but this requires further investigation."

TDM is useful to determine the best dosage regimen adapted to each patient. Here, we apply MALDI-TOF/TOF technology to quantify abacavir, amprenavir, didanosine, efavirenz, nevirapine, and stavudine in the plasma of HIV-infected patients, by standard additions analysis. Regression of standard additions was linear over the whole anti-HIV concentration range explored (1.00 x 10(-2)-1.00 pmol/microL). The absolute recovery ranged between 80% and 110%. Values of the drug concentration determined by MALDI-TOF/TOF were in the range of 1.00 x 10(-2)-1.00 pmol/microL. The limit of quantification value was 1.00 x 10(-2)pmol/microL for abacavir, amprenavir, didanosine, efavirenz, nevirapine, and stavudine."

We identified 17 patients in our pharmacokinetic database taking this combination and found conflicting results. Plasma concentrations of both ATV and lopinavir were modestly, although not significantly, decreased when the drugs were coadministered. Therefore, patients should be selected carefully for this regimen and frequent clinical and therapeutic drug monitoring is strongly advised."

It is recommended as first-line treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The standard dose of efavirenz is 600 mg/day; however, adverse central nervous system effects limit its use. Few data citing use of efavirenz at lower doses have been published. We describe a 35-year-old man with HIV infection whose virologic suppression was maintained after 18 months of treatment with efavirenz 400 mg/day. Genetic testing for cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2B6 showed that the patient was a heterozygous variant; patients with this polymorphism tend to have higher plasma efavirenz concentrations and slower plasma efavirenz clearance (prolonged elimination half-lives). Therapeutic drug monitoring also supported the dose reduction in this patient. Even with the 400-mg dose, the patient's plasma trough concentrations exceeded the upper limit of the therapeutic range. However, as he remained completely asymptomatic with this dose, no further dose reduction was necessary. This case report provides evidence that reduced efavirenz doses may be effective in the treatment of HIV infection. In addition, this case demonstrates that pharmacogenetic and pharmacokinetic testing combined with therapeutic drug monitoring may be used to guide reduced-dose, efavirenz-based therapy."
18507524,Switch from ritonavir-boosted to unboosted atazanavir guided by therapeutic drug monitoring.,"Plasma concentration of atazanavir (ATV) may be reduced when coadministered with tenofovir (TDF) or proton pump inhibitors. Boosting ATV exposure with ritonavir (r) may make it possible to overcome these drug interactions. However, jaundice and loss of the metabolic advantages of ATV are more frequent using ATV/r than ATV alone. Herein, we assessed whether therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) could make it possible to identify the subset of patients in whom removal of ritonavir could be attempted without risk of suboptimal plasma ATV exposure and subsequent virological failure. A total of 56 patients with undetectable plasma HIV-RNA under a stable triple regimen containing ATV 300/100 mg qd were switched to ATV 400 mg qd. Plasma ATV concentrations were measured using a reliable high-performance liquid chromatography method. Median plasma ATV C(min) fell from 880 to 283 ng/ml (p = 0.03) after removal of ritonavir. While all patients on ATV/r showed ATV plasma concentrations within therapeutic values (IC(min) above 150 ng/ml) before switching, four patients (7%) fell below this threshold after switching to ATV 400 mg qd. However, only one of this group experienced virological failure at week 24 of follow-up. TDF was part of the antiretroviral regimen in all four cases. From a total of 29 (52%) patients on ATV/r showing grade 3-4 hyperbilirubinemia, only 7 (12%) remained on it upon switching to ATV 400 mg qd (p < 0.001). Patients with complete viral suppression under ATV/r 300/100 mg qd may benefit from switching to ATV 400 mg qd guided by TDM, which may make it possible to minimize adverse events without compromising antiviral efficacy in most cases."
18520681,Adherence to antiretroviral therapy assessed by drug level monitoring and self-report in cameroon.,"OBJECTIVES: To compare adherence to antiretroviral therapy using drug level monitoring and self-report and to explore the relation between these 2 methods and viral load measurements. METHODS: Sixty patients received a fixed-dose combination of nevirapine, stavudine, and lamivudine in a clinical study in Cameroon. Adherence was assessed every 6 months until month 36 by nevirapine minimal plasma concentration and self-report. Plasma HIV-1 viral load was determined at the same time. Analyses included 159 complete observations. RESULTS: The proportion of patients labeled as ""adherent"" was significantly lower using nevirapine monitoring (88.7%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 82.7 to 93.2) than self-report (97.5%, CI: 93.7 to 99.3; P = 0.002). Virologic failure was associated with the nevirapine concentration (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 4.43; P = 0.018) but not with the self-reported adherence (aOR = 0.84; P = 0.9). As compared with the virologic outcome, the sensitivity of nevirapine level monitoring for predicting inadequate adherence was 20.5%, the specificity was 91.7%, the positive predictive value was 44.4%, and the negative predictive value was 78.0%. For self-report, the respective values were 2.6%, 97.5%, 25.0%, and 75.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Drug level monitoring provided a more reliable estimate of adherence than self-report. This method could be used in research settings. Operational research is required to define how to improve the accuracy of the self-report method because it is the most feasible method in clinical practice."
18536180,Pharmacokinetic monitoring of HIV-1 protease inhibitors in the antiretroviral therapy.,"Combination therapy with protease inhibitors (PIs) is used for the treatment of patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). To achieve optimal drug concentrations for viral suppression and avoidance of drug toxicity, therapeutic drug monitoring of PIs levels has been considered essential. In this study an analytical procedure for simultaneous monitoring the plasma concentrations of a total four protease inhibitors: indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir was presented. The plasma samples were liquid/liquid extracted and subjected to high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. The lopinavir and saquinavir in the patient plasma samples were monitored by ultraviolet detection at 215 nm. Extraction procedure using methyl tert-butyl ether and the mobile phase consisted from acetonitrile with phosphate buffer on a Symmetry C18 column were used to monitor these two compounds. Linearity of the method was obtained in the concentration range of 0.1 - 15.0 mg/mL for all four protease inhibitors. Under steady state conditions, the plasma concentrations of protein inhibitors in 23 patients were determined and area under the plasma concentration-time curve was estimated to maintain optimal viral suppression. We developed a simple and specific method for the simultaneous determination of lopinavir and saquinavir."
18537960,Pharmacokinetics and therapeutic drug monitoring of antiretrovirals in pregnant women.,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy is recommended for HIV-infected pregnant women to prevent mother-to-child transmission. The specific physiological background induced by pregnancy leads to significant changes in maternal pharmacokinetics, suggesting potential variability in plasma concentrations of antiretrovirals during gestation. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of protease inhibitors (PIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) is recommended in certain situations, including pregnancy, but its systematic use in HIV-infected pregnant women remains controversial. This review provides an update of the pharmacokinetic data available for PIs and NNRTIs in pregnant women and highlights the clinical interest of systematic TDM of certain antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy, including nevirapine, nelfinavir, saquinavir, indinavir and lopinavir."
18559302,Safety of long-term lopinavir plasma-levels in patients with liver disease.,"Chronic liver disease is often found in HIV infected patients. LPV as first choice drug is often used over long time periods. TDM as a tool in patients care is important but the knowledge of LPV-plasma-levels in patients with chronic liver disease remain uncertain. With this retrosepective analysis we want to show if there are differences in LPV-plasma-levels between patients with and without chronic liver diseases over a long-time period. LPV-plasma-levels were analysed with an HPLC-based methode. The LPV-plasma-levels over the time course in patients with chronic liver disease (n = 30) and patients without liver disease (n = 38) was evaluated. Liver function tests, CD4-cell count and HI-viral load was also correlated with liver disease. The LPV plasma-levels of n = 450 samples from 30 patients with liver disease (Hepatitis B: n = 17, Hepatitis C: n = 16, Alcoholic liver disease: n = 7) were determined over 18.7 +/- 16,3 months (1 - 48.5 months). A median of 10 samples per patient was eligible (2 - 50 samples). There are no significant differences according to liver disease in LPV-plasma levels (mean Ctrough without: 5917 +/- 4811 ng/ml, mean Ctrough with liver-disease: 6564 +/- 4517 ng/ml, p > 0.05). The intraindividual and interindividual variation of LPV-plasma levels, CD-4 increase, HI-virus suppression and liver tests in patients with and without liver disease is comparable. In this clinical setting no differences in LPV-plasma levels between patients with and without chronic liver disease could be demonstrated. LPV-therapy in patients with chronic liver disease is therefore safe. In patients with impaired liver function TDM is a helpful tool for dose adjustment."
18590277,Artificial ion channel biosensor in human immunodeficiency virus gp41 drug sensing.,"An ion channel biosensor is described for label-free detection of inhibitors which bind to the coiled coil domain of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 gp41. gp41 is the viral transmembrane glycoprotein responsible for fusion between HIV-1 and host cells. The N-terminal coiled coil domain binds three antiparallel C-heptad repeat peptides in the six helix bundle structure of trimeric gp41 that forms during fusion. Compounds able to prevent six-helix bundle formation by binding to the gp41 coiled coil could inhibit fusion and have important therapeutic potential. We have immobilized on gold a positively charged metallopeptide mimic of a section of the gp41 coiled coil containing a hydrophobic pocket suitable for small molecule binding. We demonstrate that the resulting sensor is able to transmit a current in the presence of negatively charged redox marker ions, therefore acting as an artificial ion channel. The electrochemical signal, measured by cyclic voltammetry, was modulated by specific analyte binding to the coiled coil. Nanomolar quantities of peptides and small molecules that bind in the hydrophobic pocket could be selectively detected, providing a method for label-free detection of binding to gp41."
18630217,Informed consent in an antiretroviral trial in Nigeria.,"We examined the process of informed consent in an antiretroviral trial in Nigeria. A semi-structured questionnaire was administered to 88 out of 180 people enrolled in the trial. This covered all aspects of the information disclosed in the leaflet of the antiretroviral trial. We found that 75 (85 per cent) of the respondents knew that the purpose of the research was to test a new drug and 13 (14 per cent) believed that they were receiving free treatment for HIV. Participants understood certain aspects of the research, especially the benefits and duration. Their understanding of the trial's risks and their right to refuse to participate and to withdraw was low. Their level of understanding was significantly related to age but not to gender, marriage, education, religion, employment and occupation. Signed informed consent is not a guarantee that participants have understood the information given to them and therefore made a voluntary decision to participate. Researchers should make sure that the process of obtaining informed consent achieves the desired outcome. This is especially important in the developing world where access to health care is limited, potential participants are poor and literacy levels are low."
18677028,Antiretroviral treatment of adult HIV infection: 2008 recommendations of the International AIDS Society-USA panel.,"CONTEXT: The availability of new antiretroviral drugs and formulations, including drugs in new classes, and recent data on treatment choices for antiretroviral-naive and -experienced patients warrant an update of the International AIDS Society-USA guidelines for the use of antiretroviral therapy in adult human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. OBJECTIVES: To summarize new data in the field and to provide current recommendations for the antiretroviral management and laboratory monitoring of HIV infection. This report provides guidelines in key areas of antiretroviral management: when to initiate therapy, choice of initial regimens, patient monitoring, when to change therapy, and how best to approach treatment options, including optimal use of recently approved drugs (maraviroc, raltegravir, and etravirine) in treatment-experienced patients. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION: A 14-member panel with expertise in HIV research and clinical care was appointed. Data published or presented at selected scientific conferences since the last panel report (August 2006) through June 2008 were identified. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data that changed the previous guidelines were reviewed by the panel (according to section). Guidelines were drafted by section writing committees and were then reviewed and edited by the entire panel. Recommendations were made by panel consensus. CONCLUSIONS: New data and considerations support initiating therapy before CD4 cell count declines to less than 350/microL. In patients with 350 CD4 cells/microL or more, the decision to begin therapy should be individualized based on the presence of comorbidities, risk factors for progression to AIDS and non-AIDS diseases, and patient readiness for treatment. In addition to the prior recommendation that a high plasma viral load (eg, >100,000 copies/mL) and rapidly declining CD4 cell count (>100/microL per year) should prompt treatment initiation, active hepatitis B or C virus coinfection, cardiovascular disease risk, and HIV-associated nephropathy increasingly prompt earlier therapy. The initial regimen must be individualized, particularly in the presence of comorbid conditions, but usually will include efavirenz or a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor plus 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (tenofovir/emtricitabine or abacavir/lamivudine). Treatment failure should be identified and managed promptly, with the goal of therapy, even in heavily pretreated patients, being an HIV-1 RNA level below assay detection limits."
18691049,Therapeutic drug monitoring in the management of HIV-infected patients.,"The rate of HIV-positive patients that fails to reach or to maintain a durable virological suppression under anti-retroviral (ARV) therapy might be as high as 50%, therefore new tools to improve ARV drug efficacy are urgently needed. Among others, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is a strategy by which the dosing regimen for a patient is guided by measurement of plasma drug levels, enabling physicians to optimize ARV drug efficacy and to avoid drug-related toxicity. The most used analytical methods to determine plasma levels of ARV drugs are HPLC-UV and HPLC-MS(/MS), recently MALDI-based methods and enzyme immunoassay (EIA) technologies have been also employed. The wide inter-patient variability in ARV drug pharmacokinetic supports the application of TDM to the clinical management of HIV-infected patients. Drug-drug and drug-food interactions, drug binding to plasma proteins, drug sequestering by erythrocytes, hepatic impairment, sex, age, pregnancy, and host genetic factors are sources of inter-patient variability affecting ARV drug pharmacokinetics. Combining the information of TDM and resistance tests in genotypic inhibitory quotient (GIQ) is likely to be of great clinical utility. Indeed, only two clinical trials on GIQ, both conducted using ARV drugs not more commonly in use, have shown clinical benefits. The design of new trials with long follow-up and sample size representative of the current HIV prevalence is urgently needed to give indications for GIQ as an early predictor of virological response. Here, the basic principles and the available methods for TDM in the management of HIV-infected patients are reviewed."
18753410,A novel CCR5-specific pharmacodynamic assay in whole blood using phosphoflow cytometry highlights different ligand-dependent responses but similar properties of antagonists in CD8+ and CD4+ T lymphocytes.,"Chemokine CC motif receptor (CCR) 5 is a major drug target for both inflammation and virology indications. The primary function of CCR5 is to mediate the trafficking of CCR5-expressing lymphocytes to any of the CCR5 ligands, which are often increased during inflammatory responses. In addition, CCR5 is a coreceptor for HIV, mediating R5 tropic HIV infection of CCR5-expressing CD4 T cells. We report the use of a novel method to assay the pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of small-molecule and antibody inhibitors of CCR5 ligand-induced activation by measuring phosphorylation of serine residue 349 in the cytoplasmic tail of human CCR5 using phosphoflow cytometry in whole blood. This assay is highly specific and measures CCR5 phosphorylation in both CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells and allows the calculation of inhibitor IC(50) values from both lymphocyte subsets in the presence of CCR5 antagonists. In addition, this assay is cross-reactive to nonhuman primates and allows PD analysis in whole blood from rhesus and cynomolgus macaque. Using this assay, we identified different ligand-dependent response properties between CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells, although CCR5 antagonists behave with similar properties against both cell types. The use of this assay may be of particular benefit to monitor PD effects of CCR5 inhibitors during drug development, preclinical in vivo studies, and in patients currently being treated for HIV or CCR5-mediated inflammatory diseases with CCR5 inhibitors. Similar phosphoflow approaches to other GPCR targets on circulating lymphocytes may prove to be the most reliable PD assay for preclinical and potentially clinical development."

18767290,[Principles of therapeutic drug monitoring].,"Requesting a blood level measurement of a drug is part of the global approach known as ""Therapeutic Drug Monitoring"". Diverse situations require this monitoring approach, such as inadequate response to treatment or organ failure. Every drug however does not possess all the characteristics for a TDM program. The therapeutic range of a TDM drug has indeed to be narrow and its interindividual pharmacokinetic variability to be wide. As the development of new drugs is currently slowing down, the precise management of existing treatments certainly deserves progress, but needs however to be applied rationally, starting from a valid indication to blood sampling, and ending with a sound dosage adaptation decision."
18767291,[Therapeutic drug monitoring: clinical practice].,"When requesting a blood level measurement in the context of ""Therapeutic drug monitoring"" (TDM), numerous aspects have to be considered in the pre-analytical and analytical area, as in the integration of associated clinical data. This review presents therapeutic classes for which a clinical benefit of TDM is established or suggested, at least in some settings. For each class of drugs, the main pharmacokinetic, pre-analytical, analytical and clinical aspects are evaluated in the scope of such a monitoring. Each step of the TDM process is important and none should be neglected. Additional clinical trials are however warranted to better establish the exact conditions of use for such a monitoring."
18784460,Evaluation of the WHO criteria for antiretroviral treatment failure among adults in South Africa.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the performance of WHO clinical and CD4 cell count criteria for antiretroviral treatment (ART) failure among HIV-infected adults in a workplace HIV care programme in South Africa. DESIGN: Cohort study. METHODS: We included initially ART-naive participants who remained on first-line therapy and had an evaluable HIV viral load result at the 12-month visit. WHO-defined clinical and CD4 cell count criteria for ART failure were compared against a gold standard of virological failure. RESULTS: Among 324 individuals (97.5% men, median age 40.2, median starting CD4 cell count and viral load 154 cells/mul and 47,503 copies/ml, respectively), 33 (10.2%) had definite or probable virological failure at 12 months, compared with 19 (6.0%) and 40 (12.5%) with WHO-defined CD4 and clinical failure, respectively. CD4 criteria had a sensitivity of 21.2% and a specificity of 95.8% in detecting virological failure, and clinical criteria had sensitivity of 15.2% and specificity of 88.1%. The positive predictive value of CD4 and clinical criteria in detecting virological failure were 36.8 and 12.8%, respectively. Exclusion of weight loss or tuberculosis failed to improve the performance of clinical criteria. CONCLUSION: WHO clinical and CD4 criteria have poor sensitivity and specificity in detecting virological failure. The low specificities and positive predictive values mean that individuals with adequate virological suppression risk being incorrectly classified as having treatment failure and unnecessarily switched to second-line therapy. Virological failure should be confirmed before switching to second-line therapy."
18931536,"Single-measurement therapeutic drug monitoring of the HIV/AIDS drugs abacavir, zidovudine, lamivudine, efavirenz, nevirapine, lopinavir and nelfinavir.","BACKGROUND: There is currently no consensus about the significance of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) in the management of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. OBJECTIVES: In this study, single drug levels from routine clinical samples were determined in order to add further data on the therapeutic plasma level range and on drug levels under anti-HIV therapy in general. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 215 plasma samples obtained from patients with HIV infection for whom TDM was requested for the first time were evaluated. Plasma values were determined for abacavir and zidovudine between 1 and 3 h after drug intake. Lamivudine, efavirenz, nevirapine, lopinavir and nelfinavir plasma values were determined between 1 and 12 h after drug intake. Drug levels were determined with a home-brewed assay based on high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Plasma concentrations of HIV drugs showed a large variability. Plasma concentrations of abacavir, zidovudine and lamivudine were found to be similar to those reported recently. For efavirenz and nevirapine, 37 and 61% of the samples did not meet the minimum trough levels suggested. For lopinavir and nelfinavir, the majority of the samples (78 and 80%) were found to be within the therapeutic plasma level range. CONCLUSION: Despite a large variation of anti-HIV drug plasma concentrations, single-measurement TDM may be sufficient in the routine management of the majority of patients."

There are no guidelines detailing the most appropriate clinical management and treatment of coinfected children. We used a semi-structured questionnaire to investigate current European practices for the management and follow-up of HIV/HCV coinfected children among clinical centres contributing to the European Collaborative Study or the European Paediatric HCV Network. Clinicians from 16 out of 24 clinical centres responded and were caring for a total of 44 HIV/HCV coinfected children. We found that, although there was a high level of concordance regarding testing for HIV and/or HCV infection, monitoring practices in these European centres varied widely. Few clinicians stated they would administer HIV and HCV treatment concurrently. Limited experience in the clinical management of this group and the lack of an evidence base to guide policy may be a barrier to achieving optimal care and treatment."
18991109,Comparison of model-based tests and selection strategies to detect genetic polymorphisms influencing pharmacokinetic parameters.,"We evaluate by simulation three model-based methods to test the influence of a single nucleotide polymorphism on a pharmacokinetic parameter of a drug: analysis of variance (ANOVA) on the empirical Bayes estimates of the individual parameters, likelihood ratio test between models with and without genetic covariate, and Wald tests on the parameters of the model with covariate. Analyses are performed using the FO and FOCE method implemented in the NONMEM software. We compare several approaches for model selection based on tests and global criteria. We illustrate the results with pharmacokinetic data on indinavir from HIV-positive patients included in COPHAR 2-ANRS 111 to study the gene effect prospectively. Only the tests based on the EBE obtain an empirical type I error close to the expected 5%. The approximation made with the FO algorithm results in a significant inflation of the type I error of the LRT and Wald tests."

Multiple drug interactions are described for both drugs because of their different action in CYP450 3A4 and p-glycoprotein. In this retrospective analysis of 22 patients during therapy with tipranavir/ritonavir (TPV) 500 mg/200 mg bid, we found significantly decreased TPV-trough levels in combination with tenofovir (15.32+/-5.22 microg/ml) in comparison to TPV trough levels without tenofovir (20.21+/-14.87 microg/ml). Therapeutic drug monitoring of TPV is recommended."
19050389,Low atazanavir concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid.,"OBJECTIVE: Protease inhibitors may not penetrate into the central nervous system in therapeutic concentrations, which may allow ongoing HIV replication and injury. The objective of this study was to determine atazanavir penetration into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). DESIGN: Single random plasma or paired plasma and CSF samples were drawn from participants enrolled in a multicenter, observational cohort study and taking atazanavir with or without ritonavir between October 2003 and October 2005. METHODS: Plasma samples were assayed by high performance liquid chromatography and immunoassay; lower limit of detection was 45 ng/ml. CSF samples were assayed by immunoassay (ARK ATV-test); lower limit of detection was 5 ng/ml. RESULTS: One hundred and seventeen participants (43 +/- 7.7 years, 79% men, 81 +/- 15 kg) had plasma or plasma and CSF paired samples drawn a median (interquartile range) of 10 (5-17) h postdose. Median (interquartile range) plasma atazanavir concentrations with or without ritonavir were 1278 (525-2265) and 523 (283-1344) ng/ml. The median (interquartile range) CSF concentrations with or without ritonavir were 10.3 (<5-21.1) and 7.9 (6.6-22) ng/ml. Nineteen of 79 (24%) CSF samples were less than 5 ng/ml. CSF concentrations were less than 1% of plasma concentrations and near the atazanavir wild-type IC50 of 1-11 ng/ml. CONCLUSION: Atazanavir CSF concentrations are highly variable and 100-fold lower than plasma concentrations, even with ritonavir boosting. CSF concentrations of atazanavir do not consistently exceed the wild-type IC50 of atazanavir and may not protect against HIV replication in the CSF."
19052483,Pharmacokinetic study of the variability of indinavir drug levels when boosted with ritonavir in HIV-infected children.,"The aim of this work is to: (1) assess therapeutic drug monitoring of indinavir (IDV) during clinical routine practice in HIV-infected children, whose antiretroviral treatment includes IDV boosted with ritonavir (RTV), and (2) describe a possible relationship between IDV pharmacokinetics and MDR1 genotypes. In 21 ambulatory pediatric patients receiving IDV plus RTV, IDV plasma levels and MDR1 genotypes on exon 26 (C3435T) were determined. Nine of the 21 patients initially receiving 250 mg/m(2) IDV yielded trough levels below 0.10 microg/ml (median: 0.21, range: 0.04-1.31 microg/ml). When the dosage was increased to 400 mg/m(2) IDV plus 100 mg/m(2) RTV b.i.d., all, except 1 patient, achieved levels above 0.10 microg/ml. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed higher volume of distribution median values related to the C/C genotype in comparison with C/T or T/T genotypes for exon 26 (4.57 vs. 1.20 and 1.50 l/kg, respectively; p = 0.002). Although a higher median value of clearance was observed with the C/C genotype, the difference was not statistically significant (1.43 vs. 0.27 and 0.42 l/h, respectively; p = 0.052). These results may be explained by a reduced absorption of the drug, related with lower plasma IDV levels in patients carrying the C/C genotype in exon 26."
19059744,"Quantification of etravirine (TMC125) in plasma, dried blood spots and peripheral blood mononuclear cell lysate by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.","For the quantification of the novel non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor etravirine in human plasma, dried blood spots and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) lysate, an assay was developed and validated, using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Etravirine was extracted from plasma by means of protein precipitation with a mixture of methanol and acetonitrile using only 50 microL plasma. Extraction from dried blood spots was performed with a one-step extraction with a mixture of methanol, acetonitrile and 0.2M zinc sulphate in water (1:1:2, v/v/v) and extraction from cell lysate was performed in 50% methanol in water. Chromatographic separation was performed on a reversed phase C18 column (150mmx2.0mm, particle size 5microm) with a quick stepwise gradient using an acetate buffer (pH 5) and methanol, at a flow rate of 0.25mL/min. (13)C(6)-efavirenz was used as an internal standard. The analytical run time was only 10min. The triple quadrupole mass spectrometer was operated in the positive ion-mode and multiple reaction monitoring was used for drug quantification. The method was validated over a range of 25-5000ng/mL in plasma, 50-10,000ng/mL in dried blood spots and a range of 5-2500ng/mL in PBMC lysate. Accuracies ranged from 89% to 106% in plasma, from 94% to 109% in dried blood spots and from 91% to 105% in PBMC lysate. Precisions at the all concentration levels ranged from 1.9% to 14% in plasma, 4.7% to 20% in dried blood spots and from 3.1% to 11% in PBMC lysate. The bioanalytical assay was successfully incorporated with previously developed assays for the determination of all currently approved PIs and NNRTIs in plasma and dried blood spots and it is now applied for therapeutic drug monitoring and pharmacological research in HIV-infected patients treated with etravirine."
19089608,Lack of association between retrospectively collected pharmacy refill data and electronic drug monitoring of antiretroviral adherence.,"Antiretroviral medication refill adherence has not been compared directly to electronic drug monitoring (EDM) in any identifiable published study. We retrospectively studied adults with undetectable HIV titers on highly active antiretroviral therapy. We used Pearson correlation coefficients and receiver operating characteristic curves to relate the two adherence measures, and we used the Wilcoxon rank-sum test to assess the relation between adherence and viral load. In sixty-five subjects, the majority of whom were African American and male with median age of 44 years, pharmacy refill adherence was difficult to collect retrospectively, was not significantly correlated with EDM adherence, and was not significantly related to viral load. Ninety-day supply pharmacy refill adherence correctly classified 95% EDM adherence maximally at 94 days between refills, and the measure was most sensitive for non-adherence at <90 days. Reassessment of the relation between pharmacy refill data and EDM would be warranted when pharmacy refill data is collected as soon as feasible from sources with complete data capture."
19103115,[Study on the threshold of HIV-1 drug resistance in Hunan province].,"OBJECTIVE: To survey the prevalence of HIV-1 drug resistance in patients newly diagnosed as HIV positive and who were younger than 25 years of age but had not received treatment with antiretroviral treatment (ART) in Hunan province. METHODS: Serum specimens of HIV infected individuals were collected and HIV-1 pol genetic mutations associated with drug resistance were identified with PCR and interpreted with Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database. RESULTS: A total number of 69 patients whose HIV sequences were amplified successfully with 2 (2.9%) specimens appeared mutations associated with HIV-1 drug resistance in the reverse transcriptase region, including one as V75M and the other one as K103N and V181C. Data showed that the prevalence of drug resistance in Hunan was 2.9%. CONCLUSION: The first line regiments of national ART seemed still effective. Most of the AIDS patients did not need to be tested on drug resistance status before starting ART. However, it is important to start HIV drug resistance surveillance in no time."
19114860,"A randomized trial of therapeutic drug monitoring of protease inhibitors in antiretroviral-experienced, HIV-1-infected patients.","OBJECTIVE: Whether therapeutic drug monitoring of protease inhibitors improves outcomes in HIV-infected patients is controversial. We evaluated this strategy in a randomized, open-label clinical trial, using a normalized inhibitory quotient (NIQ), which incorporates drug exposure and viral drug resistance. NIQs < or = 1 may predict poor outcome and identify patients who could benefit from dose escalation. DESIGN/METHODS: Eligible patients had a viral load > or =1000 copies/ml on a failing regimen, and began a new protease inhibitor containing regimen at entry. All FDA-approved protease inhibitors available during the study recruitment (June 2002-May 2006) were allowed. One hundred and eighty-three participants with NIQ < or = 1, on the basis of their week 2 protease inhibitor trough concentration and pre-entry drug resistance test, were randomized at week 4 to standard of care (SOC) or protease inhibitor dose escalation (TDM). The primary endpoint was change in log10 plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration from randomization to 20 weeks later. RESULTS: Ninety-one patients were randomized to SOC and 92 to TDM. NIQs increased more in the TDM arm compared to SOC (+69 versus +25%, P = 0.01). Despite this, TDM and SOC arms showed no difference in outcome (+0.09 versus +0.02 log10, P = 0.17). In retrospective subgroup analyses, patients with less HIV resistance to their protease inhibitors benefited from TDM (P = 0.002), as did black and Hispanic patients (P = 0.035 and 0.05, respectively). Differences between black and white patients persisted when accounting for protease inhibitor susceptibility. CONCLUSIONS: There was no overall benefit of TDM. In post hoc subgroup analyses, TDM appeared beneficial in black and Hispanic patients, and in patients whose virus retained some susceptibility to the protease inhibitors in their regimen."
19128911,"Quantification of the HIV-integrase inhibitor raltegravir and detection of its main metabolite in human plasma, dried blood spots and peripheral blood mononuclear cell lysate by means of high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.","For the quantification of the HIV-integrase inhibitor raltegravir in human plasma, dried blood spots and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) lysate, an assay was developed and validated, using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. The assay also allowed detection, but no quantification due to absence of reference substance, of the main metabolite, raltegravir-glucuronide. Raltegravir was extracted from plasma by means of protein precipitation with a mixture of methanol and acetonitrile using only 50microL plasma. Extraction from dried blood spots was performed with a simple one-step extraction with a mixture of methanol, acetonitrile and 0.2M zincsulphate in water (1:1:2, v/v/v) and extraction from cell lysate was performed in 50% methanol in water. Chromatographic separation was performed on a reversed phase C18 column (150mmx2.0mm, particle size 5microm) with a quick stepwise gradient using an acetate buffer (pH 5) and methanol, at a flow rate of 0.25mL/min. The analytical run time was 10min. The triple quadrupole mass spectrometer was operated in the positive ion-mode and multiple reaction monitoring was used for drug quantification. The method was validated over a range of 50-10,000ng/mL in plasma and dried blood spots and a range of 1-500ng/mL in PBMC lysate. Dibenzepine was used as the internal standard. The method was proven to be specific, accurate, precise and robust. Accuracies ranged from 104% to 105% in plasma, from 93% to 105% in dried blood spots and from 82% to 113% in PBMC lysate. Precision over the complete concentration range was less than 6%, 11% and 13% in plasma, dried blood spots and PBMC lysate, respectively. The method is now applied for therapeutic drug monitoring and pharmacological research in HIV-infected patients treated with raltegravir."
19133532,Guidelines for antiretroviral therapy in HIV-1 infected adults and adolescents: the recommendations of the Thai AIDS Society (TAS) 2008.,"BACKGROUND: More than 100,000 patients have been treated, since the implementation of the National Universal Coverage for antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Thailand Although there are several comprehensive guidelines available internationally, there is a need to have guidelines that can be implemented in Thailand. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The guidelines were developed by a panel of 17 members who are the experts on HIV research and/or HIV patient care and appointed without incentive by the Thai AIDS Society (TAS). The recommendations were based on evidences from the published studies and availability of antiretroviral agents. Published studies that are relevant and applicable to Thailand in particular have been taken into consideration. RESULTS: The recommendations include: when to start ART; what to start; how to monitor the therapy; adverse effects and its management; diagnosis of treatment failure; and antiretroviral treatment options in patients with treatment failure. ART in special circumstances, i.e., patients with co-infection of tuberculosis or hepatitis B virus, is also included Appropriate level of CD4+ T-cell count to start ART among Thai patients has been considered carefully. The authors recommend to start ART at CD4+ T-cell count < 200 cells/mm3. CONCLUSION: ART should be initiated in adults and adolescents HIV-1 infected patients with a history of HIV-related illness or AIDS or with a CD4+ T-cell count <200 cells/mm3. For treatment-naive patients, the preferred initial therapy is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based regimen. CD4' T-cell count and viral load should be monitored for at least twice and once a year, respectively. Proper management of antiretroviral-related toxicity and enhancement of adherence are crucial for the long-term success of ART."
19165084,Protease inhibitor levels in hair strongly predict virologic response to treatment.,"OBJECTIVE: Antiretroviral (ARV) therapies fail when behavioral or biologic factors lead to inadequate medication exposure. The currently available methods to assess ARV exposure are limited. Levels of ARVs in hair reflect plasma concentrations over weeks to months, and may provide a novel method for predicting therapeutic responses. DESIGN/METHODS: The Women's Interagency HIV Study, a prospective cohort of HIV-infected women, provided the basis for developing and assessing methods to measure commonly prescribed protease inhibitors (lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir) in small hair samples. We examined the association between hair protease inhibitor levels and initial virologic responses to therapy in multivariate logistic regression models. RESULTS: ARV concentrations in hair were strongly and independently associated with treatment response for 224 women starting a new protease inhibitor-based regimen. For participants initiating lopinavir/ritonavir, the odds ratio (OR) for virologic suppression was 39.8 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.8-564] for those with lopinavir hair levels in the top tertile (>1.9 ng/mg) compared to the bottom (</=0.41 ng/mg) when controlling for self-reported adherence, age, race, starting viral load and CD4 cell count, and prior experience with protease inhibitors. For women starting atazanavir, the adjusted OR for virologic success was 7.7 (95% CI = 2.0-29.7) for those with hair concentrations in the top tertile (>3.4 ng/mg) compared to the lowest (</=1.2 ng/mg). CONCLUSION: Protease inhibitor levels in small hair samples were the strongest independent predictor of virologic success in a diverse group of HIV-infected adults. This non-invasive method for determining ARV exposure may have particular relevance for the epidemic in resource-poor settings due to the ease of collecting and storing hair."
19195438,"[Management of renal toxicity in HIV-positive patients. What to measure, how to measure it and how frequently].","Chronic kidney disease in patients with HIV is being recognized as one of the most frequent comorbidities of this disease and consequently much research is currently being performed in this area. The possible manifestations are highly varied and consequently a high index of suspicion is required. Appropriate investigations should be performed from the moment patients first seek care to rule out renal disease and to prevent worsening, with the diagnostic or therapeutic measures that may subsequently be required. One of the most common problems is nephrotoxicity caused by some drugs and cases associated with tenofovir are becoming more frequently described. However, there is wide clinical experience with this drug and renal toxicity associated with its use is uncommon both in clinical trials and in clinical practice. Familiarity with what may happen, the associated factors and appropriate patient management are essential."
19209067,Failure of immunologic criteria to appropriately identify antiretroviral treatment failure in Uganda.,"OBJECTIVE: Most antiretroviral treatment program in resource-limited settings use immunologic or clinical monitoring to measure response to therapy and to decide when to change to a second-line regimen. Our objective was to evaluate immunologic failure criteria against gold standard virologic monitoring. DESIGN: Observational cohort. METHODS: Participants enrolled in an antiretroviral treatment program in rural Uganda who had at least 6 months of follow-up were included in this analysis. Immunologic monitoring was performed by CD4 cell counts every 3 months during the first year, and every 6 months thereafter. HIV-1 viral loads were performed every 6 months. RESULTS: A total of 1133 participants enrolled in the Rakai Health Sciences Program antiretroviral treatment program between June 2004 and September 2007 were followed for up to 44.4 months (median follow-up 20.2 months; IQR 12.4-29.5 months). WHO immunologic failure criteria were reached by 125 (11.0%) participants. A virologic failure endpoint defined as HIV-1 viral load more than 400 copies/ml on two measurements was reached by 112 participants (9.9%). Only 26 participants (2.3%) experienced both an immunologic and virologic failure endpoint (2 viral load > 400 copies/ml) during follow-up. CONCLUSION: Immunologic failure criteria performed poorly in our setting and would have resulted in a substantial proportion of participants with suppressed HIV-1 viral load being switched unnecessarily. These criteria also lacked sensitivity to identify participants failing virologically. Periodic viral load measurements may be a better marker for treatment failure in our setting."
19210693,"Effects of ritonavir-boosted darunavir vs. ritonavir-boosted atazanavir on lipid and glucose parameters in HIV-negative, healthy volunteers.","BACKGROUND: Darunavir (TMC114) is a new HIV protease inhibitor (PI). DESIGN: This Phase I, randomized, open-label trial compared the effects of darunavir plus low-dose ritonavir (RTV) (darunavir/RTV) with those of atazanavir/RTV on lipid and glucose parameters. METHODS: Forty-nine HIV-negative, healthy male volunteers received RTV 100 mg once a day (qd) for 7 days, followed by either darunavir/RTV 800/100 mg qd (n=25) or atazanavir/RTV 300/100 mg qd (n=24) for 21 days. Mean changes in fasting lipid and glucose parameters at day 28 were calculated using post-RTV alone (day 7) and baseline (day -1) values as references. Short-term safety, tolerability and RTV pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated. RESULTS: After 7 days of RTV treatment, the mean triglyceride concentration increased by approximately 30 mg/dL in both groups, changes in other lipid and glucose parameters were relatively small. Mean concentrations of lipids and glucose over the treatment period were mostly similar between the treatment groups. Mean changes from day 7 to day 28 for the darunavir/RTV and atazanavir/RTV groups, respectively, were -3.6 and -0.5 mg/dL for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; 5.0 and 5.3 mg/dL for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; 4.9 and 1.2 mg/dL for total cholesterol; 6.4 and 14.0 mg/dL for triglycerides; -1.7 and -2.4 mg/dL for glucose; and -1.4 and 0.3 mg/dL for insulin. No grade 3 or 4 lipid or glucose laboratory abnormalities were reported. Treatment-emergent hyperbilirubinaemia was reported for all volunteers (including five grade 4 cases) during atazanavir/RTV treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Co-administration of darunavir or atazanavir with low-dose RTV resulted in minor and similar changes in lipid and glucose parameters in HIV-negative healthy volunteers."
19232158,Protease inhibitor plasma concentrations in HIV antiretroviral therapy.,"Since the introduction of the HIV protease inhibitors in 1995, considerable progress has been made in the treatment of HIV-infected patients. However, treatment has not been without problems. Studies have demonstrated associations between protease inhibitor concentrations and efficacy and in some cases toxicity. As considerable inter-individual and intra-individual variations of protease inhibitor concentrations have been observed, it has been questioned to what extent this has clinical implications with regard to efficacy and toxicity. As a consequence the use of protease inhibitor concentration measurements to optimise HIV antiretroviral therapy (therapeutic drug monitoring--TDM) has been suggested. The objectives of this study, initiated in 2000, were: to establish a method for the simultaneous measurement of the available protease inhibitors; to explore the pharmacokinetics of the protease inhibitors in clinically relevant situations and in this context; to consider the applicability of TDM in protease inhibitor therapy. The presented studies and review demonstrate: 1) that it is feasible to measure protease inhibitor plasma concentrations in a clinical setting with precision and accuracy, and that protease inhibitor concentrations are very stable during different circumstances ex vivo; 2) that protease inhibitor plasma concentrations display limited long-term intra-individual variation but considerable inter-individual variation; 3) that protease inhibitor plasma concentrations display considerable intra-individual variations between morning and evening and in the case of drug-drug interactions; 4) that protease inhibitor drug-drug interactions can be unpredictable and adverse but also that protease inhibitor drug-drug interactions can be exploited to increase protease inhibitor concentrations or decrease protease inhibitor dose; 5) that increases in protease inhibitor plasma concentrations can enhance efficacy but also that decreases can reduce toxicity; 6) that the concentration-efficacy associations which have been established by others can be confirmed in clinical trials but that concentration-toxicity associations are more difficult to establish and confirm. The experiences with protease inhibitor therapy and the understanding of protease inhibitor pharmacokinetics have resulted in new treatment principles and the development of new and better protease inhibitors. Most patients achieve concentrations several folds higher than the minimum effective concentration with the regimens that are used currently (2007). As a result TDM in protease inhibitor therapy has become less relevant in HIV-infected patients receiving their first protease inhibitor. In protease inhibitor experienced patients, harbouring HIV with varying degrees of resistance/reduced susceptibility to protease inhibitors, the combination of TDM and genotypic resistance testing, seems to be a promising tool, but prospective studies are needed. In some patients with certain conditions or in certain circumstances known to be associated with considerable inter-individual or intra-individual variation of protease inhibitor concentrations (drug-drug interactions, gastrointestinal disease, pregnancy or children) TDM might also be of benefit. However, no studies have investigated these patients specifically in randomised TDM trials."
19246124,[Recommendations from the GESIDA/Spanish AIDS Plan regarding antiretroviral treatment in adults with human immunodeficiency virus infection (update February 2009)].,"OBJECTIVE: This consensus document is an update of antiretroviral therapy recommendations for adult patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. METHODS: To formulate these recommendations, a panel comprised of members of the Grupo de Estudio de Sida (Gesida, AIDS Study Group) and the Plan Nacional sobre el Sida (PNS, Spanish AIDS Plan) reviewed the advances in current understanding of the pathophysiology of HIV infection, and the efficacy and safety results from clinical trials, cohort studies, and pharmacokinetic studies published in biomedical journals or presented at scientific meetings over the last 2 years. Three levels of evidence were defined according to the data source: randomized studies (level A), cohort or case-control studies (level B), and expert opinion (level C). The decision to recommend, consider, or not recommend antiretroviral therapy (ART) was established in each situation. RESULTS: The current treatment of choice for chronic HIV infection is a combination of 3 drugs from 2 different classes; that is, 2 nucleoside or nucleotide analogs (NRTI) plus 1 non-nucleoside (NNRTI) or 1 boosted protease inhibitor (PI/r). ART initiation is recommended in patients with symptomatic HIV infection. In asymptomatic patients, initiation of ART is recommended on the basis of CD4 lymphocyte counts, plasma viral load and the patient's comorbid conditions, as follows: a) therapy should be started in patients with CD4 counts of <350 cells/microl; b) when CD4 count is between 350 and 500 cells/microl, therapy should be started in patients with chronic hepatitis C or cirrhosis, coinfection with hepatitis B requiring treatment, high cardiovascular risk, HIV nephropathy, HIV viral load >10(5)copies/ml, or<14% CD4 cells; c) therapy should be deferred when CD4 count is >500 cells/microl, but can be considered if any of the previous circumstances concur. The objective of ART is to achieve an undetectable viral load. Adherence to therapy plays an essential role in maintaining antiviral response. Therapeutic options are limited after ART failures, but undetectable viral load may be possible with new drugs, even in highly drug-experienced patients. Genotype studies are useful in these situations. Drug toxicity from ART therapy is losing importance as benefits exceed adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: CD4 cell count, viral load, and patient comorbidities are the most important reference factors to consider when initiating ART in asymptomatic patients. The large number of available drugs, the increasing sensitivity of tests to monitor viral load, and the ability to determine viral resistance is leading to a more individualized therapy approach, with the goal of achieving undetectable viral load in any circumstance. The complete version of the recommendations can be found on the Gesida (http://www.gesida.seimc.org) or PNS (http://www.msc.es/ciudadanos/enfLesiones/enfTransmisibles/sida/home.htm) web sites."
19319971,Simultaneous determination of maraviroc and raltegravir in human plasma by HPLC-UV.,"Therapeutic drug monitoring is pivotal to improve the management of HIV infection. Here, a new HPLC-UV method to quantify simultaneously maraviroc and raltegravir levels in human plasma is reported. Remarkably, this is the first method for maraviroc determination in human plasma. The volume of the plasma sample was 600 microL. This method involved automated solid-phase extraction with Oasis HLB Cartridge 1 cc (30 mg divinylbenzene and N-vinylpyrrolidone) and evaporation in a water bath under nitrogen stream. The extracted samples were reconstituted with 200 microL 50/50 of mobile-phase solution (0.01 M KH(2)PO(4) and acetonitrile). Twenty microliters of these samples were injected into a HPLC-UV system, the analytes were eluted on an analytical dC18 Atlantis column (150 mm x 4.6 mm I.D.) with a particle size of 5 microm. The mobile phase (0.01 M KH(2)PO(4) and acetonitrile) was delivered at 1.0 mL/min with isocratic elution. The total run time for a single analysis was 10 min; maraviroc and raltegravir were detected by UV at 197 and 300 nm. The calibration curves were linear up to 2,500 ng/mL. The absolute recovery ranged between 93 and 100%. The HPLC-UV method reported here has been validated and is currently applied to monitor plasma levels of maraviroc and raltegravir in HIV-infected patients."
19383934,Long-term efficacy and safety of TDM-assisted combination of voriconazole plus efavirenz in an AIDS patient with cryptococcosis and liver cirrhosis.,"OBJECTIVE: To report the efficacy, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic effects of combined voriconazole and efavirenz treatment administered at therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM)-based adjusted doses to a patient with AIDS, cryptococcosis, and mild liver cirrhosis. CASE SUMMARY: A 40-year-old man with AIDS (hemophiliac, antiretroviral-naive, plasma HIV-RNA = 290,000 copies/mL, CD4+ lymphocytes = 0), hepatitis C virus-related liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A), and cryptococcal meningitis was failing standard antifungal therapies. He received an antifungal-antiretroviral combination treatment based on the association of voriconazole plus efavirenz. Doses of both drugs were serially adjusted based on their plasma concentrations, which were evaluated at steady-state of each dose combination at least once (week 3.1 or later) as full concentration-time profile (samples collected at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 h postdose). Adequate concentrations of voriconazole in both plasma and cerebrospinal fluid were obtained and target plasma concentrations of efavirenz were achieved at the final dose adjustment (voriconazole 200 mg twice daily plus efavirenz 300 mg once daily, both administered orally). The patient showed prompt and stable suppression of cryptococcosis and plasma viremia of HIV at long-term follow-up (66 wk), with no significant adverse events. DISCUSSION: Standard therapies for cryptococcosis in patients with AIDS are often not effective. Voriconazole, despite its promising anticryptococcal efficacy, is currently not approved for cryptococcosis therapy in the US and Europe, nor is it recommended for combination with efavirenz due to the significant pharmacokinetic interactions between the 2 compounds. Thus far, published studies regarding the effects of voriconazole in human cryptococcosis are scarce and none has described the clinical and pharmacokinetic outcomes of a voriconazole/efavirenz combination in patients with AIDS, either with or without liver cirrhosis. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of voriconazole and efavirenz at TDM-assisted doses may represent a valuable therapeutic option in AIDS patients with cryptococcosis and mild liver cirrhosis."
19397460,Therapeutic drug monitoring of antimycobacterial drugs in patients with both tuberculosis and advanced human immunodeficiency virus infection.,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the feasibility of therapeutic drug monitoring for adjusting low serum antimycobacterial concentrations in patients with both tuberculosis and advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. DATA SOURCE: De-identified dataset from a tuberculosis clinic. PATIENTS: Twenty-one patients (median age 38 yrs, range 25-68 yrs) with advanced HIV infection (CD4(+) cell count < 100 cells/mm(3)) who received treatment for active tuberculosis between March 2002 and September 2007. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We evaluated data based on the practices performed at the tuberculosis clinic. After the daily doses of isoniazid and rifamycins (rifampin or rifabutin) were ingested, serum concentrations were obtained at 2 hours for isoniazid and rifampin, at 3 hours for rifabutin, and, when possible, at 6 hours for all three drugs to detect delayed absorption. Antimycobacterial drug concentrations were compared with published reference levels, and dosages were adjusted to achieve desired concentrations. Costs of monitoring were recorded for all patients. Of the 21 patients, 18 (86%) had low serum concentrations of at least one drug 2 hours after ingestion: 2 (10%) had low isoniazid concentrations, 5 (24%) had low rifamycin concentrations, and 11 (52%) had low serum concentrations of both drugs. The median number of dosage adjustments to attain normal concentrations was 1 (range 0-4 adjustments). The median cost/patient for therapeutic drug monitoring was $619 (range $230-1948). The median final doses to achieve normal concentrations were isoniazid 600 mg/day (range 300-1500 mg/day), rifampin 1050 mg/day (range 600-1200 mg/day), and rifabutin 300 mg (range 150-450 mg) 3 times/week. No patient demonstrated any adverse effects attributed to these higher doses. CONCLUSION: Low serum concentrations of antituberculous drugs, which suggest malabsorption, are common among patients with advanced HIV who also have tuberculosis but can be overcome with higher doses. Therapeutic drug monitoring may be an effective tool to optimize therapy, but needs further study."
19430099,"Safety and efficacy of a double-boosted protease inhibitor combination, saquinavir and lopinavir/ritonavir, in pretreated children at 96 weeks.","BACKGROUND: This study aimed to assess the long-term efficacy, safety and use of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of a double-boosted protease inhibitor (PI) combination, saquinavir (SQV) and lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r), in Thai HIV type-1 (HIV-1)-infected children who had failed on reverse transcriptase inhibitors. METHODS: In total, 50 children from two sites in Thailand were treated with standard dosing of SQV and LPV/r. CD4(+) T-cell count and percentage, viral load (VL; HIV-1 RNA), minimum plasma drug concentrations (C(min)) and drug safety laboratory evaluations were monitored. Virological failure was defined as having two consecutive VL measures >400 copies/ml after week 12. An intention-to-treat analysis was performed. RESULTS: Baseline data were a median age of 9.3 years (interquartile range [IQR] 7.1-11.2), VL 4.8 log(10) copies/ml (IQR 4.5-5.1) and CD4(+) T-cell percentage 7% (IQR 3.0-9.5). CDC classifications were N=4%, A=14%, B=68% and C=14% of participants. Median CD4(+) T-cell percentage and CD4(+) T-cell count increase were 14% (IQR 7-19) and 558 cells/mm(3) (IQR 308-782), respectively (both P<0.001). Overall, 37 (74%) children achieved VL<50 copies/ml with significant differences between sites (90% versus 63%). Over 96 weeks, 10 patients had virological failure. Total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein increased significantly over time, whereas the triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein did not. Approximately 50% of participants reported no change in body shape, and 33%, 43% and 39% reported fatter arms, face and abdomen, respectively. LPV and SQV C(min) were high and stable over time. CONCLUSIONS: Double-boosted SQV+LPV/r was an effective and safe alternative for a second-line regimen in children. Hypercholesterolaemia needs close follow-up. On the basis of the TDM results, PI dose reduction in this population should be considered."

19487167,Validation and clinical application of a high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the quantitative determination of 10 anti-retrovirals in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.,"This paper reports the validation of a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method that allows the quantification of 10 antiretroviral (ARV) drugs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using 6 different isotopic internal standards (IS) and its clinical application. PBMCs are isolated from blood by density gradient centrifugation and drugs are extracted with a 60% methanol (MeOH) solution containing the 6 IS. The cell extract is then injected in the HPLC system and analytes are separated on a Symmetry Shield RP18 2.1 mm x 50 mm column. The different molecules are then detected by MS/MS in electrospray positive or negative ionisation modes and data are recorded using the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. Calibration curves are constructed in the range of 0.25-125 ng/ml of cell extract by a 1/x(2) weighted quadratic regression. The regression coefficients obtained are always greater than 0.99 and back calculated values always comprised in the range of +/-15% from their nominal concentration. Mean extraction recoveries are greater than 80% for all analytes and the method is accurate and precise with CV and bias lower than 9.4%. The lower limits of quantification (LLOQ) of the different drugs range from 0.0125 to 0.2 ng/ml of cell extract. This method was successfully applied to a cohort of 98 HIV-infected patients treated with Kaletra (400/100 mg of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV) twice a day, n=48) or with Stocrin (600 mg once a day, n=50) and has been tested for cellular quantification of tipranavir (TPV) in 2 patients treated with Aptivus (500 mg twice a day). The patients treated by Kaletra showed mean cell-associated concentrations (CC) of 1819.0 and 917.2 ng/ml, for LPV and RTV, respectively. Patients treated with Stocrin showed mean CC of 2388.11 ng/ml while both patients under Aptivus showed TPV CC of 4322.7 and 1078.0 ng/ml, respectively. This method can be used to analyze ARV drug concentrations within the target tissue."
19491318,Adverse effects of antiretrovirals in HIV-infected pregnant women.,"BACKGROUND: Current guidelines for the use of antiretroviral (ARV) therapy during pregnancy recommend that women be offered treatment with combination ARV therapy used in nonpregnant HIV-infected individuals. It is unclear whether the risk of ARV-related adverse drug reactions (ADRs) is increased during pregnancy. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the frequency and severity of ADRs likely caused by ARV therapy in pregnant women who are HIV-positive. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of HIV-infected women who received ARV therapy during pregnancy and delivered between January 1997 and February 2006 was conducted. Incidence of maternal ADRs was determined through evaluation of laboratory findings, documented physical examinations, and patient self-reports. An AIDS Clinical Trials Group severity grading scale was applied to the ADRs. Cause-effect relationship was adjudicated based on the Naranjo probability scale and, if causality was found, that information was included. RESULTS: There were 103 women who accounted for 133 pregnancies that resulted in deliveries. Of the 111 pregnancies in which treatment was received, regimens included 26 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor monotherapy, 40 nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based, 44 protease inhibitor (PI)-based, and 1 PI/NNRTI combination therapy. Ninety-eight ADRs were documented in 49 pregnancies. The most common ADRs were gastrointestinal (n = 48), followed by central nervous system symptoms (n = 15), anemia (n = 15), elevated liver/pancreatic enzyme levels (n = 11), and cutaneous reactions (n = 8). Severe ADRs included elevations in liver/pancreatic enzymes (n = 3), nausea and vomiting (n = 3), and anemia (n = 2). Seven women required a change in therapy due to an ADR. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 7 ADRs were reported for every 10 pregnancies in this cohort. Most ADRs were mild to moderate. Short exposure times in most women (second and third trimester) may have accounted for the lack of long-term toxicities. Although ADRs did not pose a major barrier to use of ARVs in pregnancy, close monitoring of pregnant women receiving ARV therapy continues to be warranted."

19531928,Switching to second-line antiretroviral therapy in resource-limited settings: comparison of programmes with and without viral load monitoring.,"BACKGROUND: In high-income countries, viral load is routinely measured to detect failure of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and guide switching to second-line ART. Viral load monitoring is not generally available in resource-limited settings. We examined switching from nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based first-line regimens to protease inhibitor-based regimens in Africa, South America and Asia. DESIGN AND METHODS: Multicohort study of 17 ART programmes. All sites monitored CD4 cell count and had access to second-line ART and 10 sites monitored viral load. We compared times to switching, CD4 cell counts at switching and obtained adjusted hazard ratios for switching (aHRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from random-effects Weibull models. RESULTS: A total of 20 113 patients, including 6369 (31.7%) patients from 10 programmes with access to viral load monitoring, were analysed; 576 patients (2.9%) switched. Low CD4 cell counts at ART initiation were associated with switching in all programmes. Median time to switching was 16.3 months [interquartile range (IQR) 10.1-26.6] in programmes with viral load monitoring and 21.8 months (IQR 14.0-21.8) in programmes without viral load monitoring (P < 0.001). Median CD4 cell counts at switching were 161 cells/microl (IQR 77-265) in programmes with viral load monitoring and 102 cells/microl (44-181) in programmes without viral load monitoring (P < 0.001). Switching was more common in programmes with viral load monitoring during months 7-18 after starting ART (aHR 1.38; 95% CI 0.97-1.98), similar during months 19-30 (aHR 0.97; 95% CI 0.58-1.60) and less common during months 31-42 (aHR 0.29; 95% CI 0.11-0.79). CONCLUSION: In resource-limited settings, switching to second-line regimens tends to occur earlier and at higher CD4 cell counts in ART programmes with viral load monitoring compared with programmes without viral load monitoring."
19555900,Virological monitoring and resistance to first-line highly active antiretroviral therapy in adults infected with HIV-1 treated under WHO guidelines: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Antiretroviral-therapy rollout in resource-poor countries is often associated with limited, if any, HIV-RNA monitoring. The effect of variable monitoring on the emergence of resistance after therapy with commonly used drug combinations was assessed by systematic review of studies reporting resistance in patients infected with HIV with a CD4 count of fewer than 200 cells per muL treated with two nucleoside analogues (including a thymidine analogue) and a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. 8376 patients from eight cohorts and two prospective studies were analysed. Resistance at virological failure to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors at 48 weeks was 88.3% (95% CI 82.2-92.9) in infrequently monitored patients, compared with 61.0% (48.9-72.2) in frequently monitored patients (p<0.001). Lamivudine resistance was 80.5% (72.9-86.8) and 40.3% (29.1-52.2) in infrequently and frequently monitored patients, respectively (p<0.001); the prevalence of at least one thymidine analogue mutation was 27.8% (21.2-35.2) and 12.1% (5.9-21.4), respectively (p<0.001). Genotypic resistance at 48 weeks to lamivudine, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (thymidine analogue mutations), and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors appears substantially higher in less frequently monitored patients. This Review highlights the need for cheap point-of-care viral-load tests to identify early viral failures and limit the emergence of resistance."

19588422,Therapeutic drug monitoring of antiretrovirals for people with HIV.,"BACKGROUND: Despite the efficacy of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) and the improvement in prognosis of those living with HIV/AIDS, a large proportion of individuals on ART does not achieve or maintain adequate virological suppression. Several tools have been proposed to enhance ART outcomes, including therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of antiretrovirals (ARVs). The aim of ARV TDM is to identify elevated (potentially toxic) or low (potentially sub-therapeutic) ARV concentrations. ARV TDM may thus optimise efficacy and minimise toxicity of ART. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether ARV TDM reduces mortality and morbidity of adult patients on ART. The primary outcome measures that have been assessed include death (all cause); occurrence of HIV-related events (death or AIDS-defining illness) and the proportion of patients achieving and maintaining an undetectable viral load, as defined by the authors. SEARCH STRATEGY: We conducted a comprehensive search including both published and unpublished studies in all languages in MEDLINE, EMBASE and The Cochrane Library, between January 1980 and January 2008. Databases listing conference abstracts and reference lists of articles were searched. Additional data were sought from relevant authors; however, no additional data were provided. SELECTION CRITERIA: Only randomized controlled trials conducted subsequent to the introduction of combination ART were included in this systematic review. Participants could be on either a protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimen or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase (NNRTI)-based regimen and be either ARV-naive or -experienced. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently assessed and extracted data for analysis. Meta-analysis was conducted where appropriate. Where study outcomes could not be combined, a narrative review was performed. Outcome measures for dichotomous data were reported as a relative risk with 95% confidence intervals. Stratified analyses were conducted by ARV regimen and treatment groups. Heterogeneity between studies was anticipated; therefore, random effects models were chosen to generate pooled effects. Differences in the findings were assessed by the chi square test for heterogeneity (p <0.1) that was quantified by the Higgins I(2) statistic. MAIN RESULTS: Identified were 1408 records, and eight trials with a total of 1181 participants were included in the review. Trials were conducted in higher income earning countries between 2002 and 2007. Sample sizes ranged between 40 and 230. The methodological quality of the studies was judged to be generally good, although allocation concealment was reported in only three of the eight studies. A meta-analysis including three studies did not show any significant effect on virological suppression below 500 HIV-RNA copies/mL at one year (RR 1.28; [0.86, 1.92] chi(2) = 11.55 (P = 0.003), I(2) = 83%). Two trials including participants predominantly treated with unboosted PI-based regimens reported a 49% increased likelihood of achieving a HIV-RNA viral load below 500 copies/mL at 52 weeks (RR 1.49 [1.20, 1.83] chi(2) = 0.69 (P = 0.4), I(2) = 0%). Safety outcomes were reported in four studies and were similar between TDM and standard of care. Uptake of expert advice based on TDM results was good in two trials (>70%), but low (<35%) in the remaining three studies that reported uptake of the recommendations. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Our review does not support routine use of ARV TDM in ARV-naive or -experienced patients on either boosted PI or NNRTI ART regimens. TDM in treatment-naive participants on a PI-based ART regimen, particularly if unboosted by ritonavir, may improve virological outcomes. Trials were underpowered with small sample sizes, short durations of follow-up and generally poor uptake of TDM recommendations. As these trials were conducted in higher income earning countries, results may not be generalisable to resource-limited countries where the burden of HIV is heaviest."
19593159,Efavirenz dose reduction is safe in patients with high plasma concentrations and may prevent efavirenz discontinuations.,"OBJECTIVE: To establish whether efavirenz dose reduction in patients with high plasma concentrations prevents toxicity-induced efavirenz discontinuations. METHODS: HIV-infected patients with a high efavirenz plasma concentration (>or=4.0 mg/L) while using efavirenz 600 mg once daily as part of their highly active antiretroviral therapy regimen were selected from the AIDS Therapy Evaluation in The Netherlands cohort study. These patients were classified into 2 groups. The reduced-dose group contained all patients who underwent dose reduction after the high plasma concentration measurement; the standard-dose group consisted of patients who had no dose reduction. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards analysis were used to assess the impact of dose reduction on toxicity-induced efavirenz discontinuations. RESULTS: One hundred eighty patients with high plasma efavirenz levels were included, 47 of them subsequently had their efavirenz dose reduced from 600 mg to 400 mg once-daily, which resulted in a 41% decrease in the median efavirenz plasma concentration. At week 48, the Kaplan-Meier estimated cumulative incidence of toxicity-induced efavirenz discontinuations was 11.5% in patients who continued the standard dose versus 2.3% in patients who had a dose reduction; P = 0.066 (log-rank test). Dose reduction was not associated with loss of virological suppression. CONCLUSIONS: Dose reduction may prevent toxicity-induced discontinuations in patients with high efavirenz plasma concentrations, whereas not compromising virological efficacy."
19709326,Benefit of therapeutic drug monitoring of protease inhibitors in HIV-infected patients depends on PI used in HAART regimen--ANRS 111 trial.,"As a result of high inter-patient variability, and efficacy-concentration and toxicity-concentration relationships, optimization of HIV-protease inhibitor (PI) doses based on plasma concentrations could be beneficial. During a 48-week open prospective non-randomized interventional study of 115 protease inhibitor-naive patients initiating an indinavir/ritonavir- or lopinavir/ritonavir-, or nelfinavir-containing therapy, protease inhibitor dose was modified when plasma trough concentrations (C(trough)) at weeks 2, 8, 16 and 24 were outside predefined optimal concentration ranges. Failure of the strategy was defined as the proportions of patients with HIV-RNA above 200 copies/mL from weeks 24 to 48 and/or experiencing grades 2, 3 or 4 PI-related adverse events during the study; proportion of patients with last C(trough) measurement outside the concentration range was determined at each visit. Virological failure and/or occurrence of adverse event were observed in 37/94 assessable patients (39%; 95% CI: 29.4-50.0). In the on-treatment analysis, failure of the strategy was noted in 16% of indinavir/r- or lopinavir/r-treated patients (8/51; 95% CI: 7.0-28.6; virological failure: 2; adverse event: 6) but in 44% of nelfinavir-treated patients (11/25; 95% CI: 24.4-65.1; virological failure: 10; adverse event: 1); C(trough) concentrations outside the range were less frequent at the last measurement than at W2 (41% vs. 66%; P < 0.05), with proportions of 35% for indinavir/r- or lopinavir/r-treated patients, but 57% for nelfinavir-treated patients. The proposed strategy of therapeutic drug monitoring may be beneficial to indinavir/r- and lopinavir/r-treated patients, but failed to move concentrations into the predefined range and to produce the expected virological success for nelfinavir-treated patients."
19729260,Two-dimensional LC-MS/MS determination of antiretroviral drugs in rat serum and urine.,"A simple, rapid, reliable and highly sensitive on-line two-dimensional reversed-phase liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (2D-LC/MS/MS) method to determine antiretroviral drugs viz., abacavir (ABC), nevirapine (NVP) and indinavir (IDV) in rat serum and urine was developed and validated. The analytes were extracted on-line from rat serum and urine by a restricted access material (RAM) column and back-flushed into the reversed-phase C18 column for separation by LC. Detection was carried out by ESI-MS/MS. The developed method showed good selectivity, accuracy and precision for quantification of the antiretroviral drugs in rat serum and urine. Quantification limits for abacavir and nevirapine were 4.0 ng ml(-1), whereas for indinavir 4.7 ng ml(-1). The calibration graphs were linear in the range of 4-50 ng ml(-1)for abacavir, nevirapine and indinavir. The method was successfully applied to study the pharmacokinetics of antiretroviral in rats."
19732081,HIV-1 DNA proviral load in treated and untreated HIV-1 seropositive patients.,"As proviral human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) DNA can replenish and revive viral infection upon activation, its detection might offer significant therapeutic information, complementing the input provided by plasma RNA determination in the follow-up of infected individuals. A selected group of acutely infected subjects was studied to verify both total and 2-long terminal repeat (2-LTR) DNA proviral load during the acute phase of infection and thereafter. Patients were divided in two sex- and age-matched groups: 19 naive individuals who did not receive antiretroviral therapy during the observation period and 20 subjects treated according to current guidelines. Total and 2-LTR HIV-1 DNA proviral load, in addition to RNA viral load and CD4 cell count, were determined in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) at baseline, 6 and 12 months after the first sampling. Total and 2-LTR HIV-1 DNA proviral load exhibited no significant variation at any time in the naive patients (total HIV-1 DNA ranging from 896 + or - 731 to 715 + or - 673 copies/10(5) PBMC and 2-LTR HIV-1 DNA ranging from 94 + or - 105 to 65 + or - 44 copies/10(5) PBMC), whereas a significant reduction in both total HIV-1 DNA (ranging from 997 + or - 676 to 262 + or - 174 copies/10(5) PBMC) and 2-LTR HIV-1 DNA proviral load (ranging from 116 + or - 55 to 26 + or - 35 copies/10(5) PBMC) was detected in highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) patients, together with a CD4(+) T cell count increase and RNA load decrease. HAART negatively affects both the labile HIV burden and the integrated proviral DNA, at least in the initial period of successful treatment, suggesting that quantification of HIV-1 DNA proviral load may be an important parameter in monitoring HIV infection."
19771504,Using electronic drug monitor feedback to improve adherence to antiretroviral therapy among HIV-positive patients in China.,"Effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) requires excellent adherence. Little is known about how to improve ART adherence in many HIV/AIDS-affected countries, including China. We therefore assessed an adherence intervention among HIV-positive patients in southwestern China. Eighty subjects were enrolled and monitored for 6 months. Sixty-eight remaining subjects were randomized to intervention/control arms. In months 7-12, intervention subjects were counseled using EDM feedback; controls continued with standard of care. Among randomized subjects, mean adherence and CD4 count were 86.8 vs. 83.8% and 297 vs. 357 cells/microl in intervention vs. control subjects, respectively. At month 12, among 64 subjects who completed the trial, mean adherence had risen significantly among intervention subjects to 96.5% but remained unchanged in controls. Mean CD4 count rose by 90 cells/microl and declined by 9 cells/microl among intervention and control subjects, respectively. EDM feedback as a counseling tool appears promising for management of HIV and other chronic diseases."
19773634,Efavirenz plasma concentrations did not predict cessation of therapy due to neuropsychiatric symptoms in a large randomized trial.,"To assess whether trial participants who ceased efavirenz (EFV) because of neuropsychiatric events had elevated plasma concentrations, we performed a retrospective case-control study. EFV levels were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography in stored plasma from 35 cases and 75 matched controls. All had taken EFV for at least 4 weeks. Median EFV concentrations did not differ (P = 0.77). Measurement of EFV levels in plasma collected at variable times after the last dose did not predict central nervous system intolerance."
19776036,Dried blood spots can expand access to virological monitoring of HIV treatment in resource-limited settings.,"The global scale-up of antiretroviral treatment in past years has, unfortunately, not been accompanied by adequate strengthening of laboratory capacity. Monitoring of treatment with HIV viral load and resistance testing, as recommended in industrialized countries, is rarely available in resource-limited settings due to high costs and stringent requirements for storage and transport of plasma. Consequently, treatment failure usually passes unnoticed until severe symptoms occur, when resistance mutations have accumulated and second-line drug options are restricted. Dried blood spots (DBS) are easy to collect and store, and can be a convenient alternative to plasma. Recently, a number of studies have demonstrated the feasibility and reliability of using DBS to monitor viral load and genotypic resistance. Moreover, several African countries have already started to use DBS for paediatric HIV screening. In the absence of point-of-care assays, the WHO should encourage virological monitoring on DBS in antiretroviral treatment programmes in resource-limited settings."
19785516,Apoptosis: a clinically useful measure of antiretroviral drug toxicity?,"Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has improved life expectancy with HIV infection, but long-term toxicities associated with these medications are now a major global disease burden. There is a clear need to develop useful methods for monitoring patients on antiretroviral drugs for early signs of toxicity. Assays with predictive utility -- allowing therapy to be changed before serious end organ damage occurs -- would be ideal. Attempts to develop biochemical methods of monitoring ART toxicity have concentrated on the mitochondrial toxicity of nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors and have not generally lead to assays with widespread clinical applications. For example, plasma lactate and peripheral blood measurements of mitochondrial DNA associate with exposure to potentially toxic nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors but have not reliably predicted clinical toxicity. Better assays are needed, including markers of toxicity from additional drug classes. Apoptosis may be a potential marker of ART toxicity. Increased apoptosis has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo in association with various antiretroviral drug classes and a range of clinical toxicities. However, quantifying apoptosis on biopsy specimens of tissue (such as adipose tissue) is impractical for patient monitoring. Novel assays have been described that can quantify apoptosis using minute tissue samples and initial results from clinical samples suggest peripheral blood may have utility in predicting ART toxicities. The limitations and potential of such techniques for monitoring patients for drug side effects will be discussed."
19835489,Voriconazole use and pharmacokinetics in combination with interferon-gamma for refractory cryptococcal meningitis in a patient receiving low-dose ritonavir.,"We present a case of relapsing cryptococcal meningitis unresponsive to standard therapy. Voriconazole induction, including the utilization of voriconazole therapeutic drug monitoring in both serum and CSF, with transition to voriconazole plus interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) was successfully used in a patient receiving antiretroviral therapy with abacavir/lamivudine and lopinavir/ritonavir. Initial voriconazole levels at standard doses of 4 mg/kg twice daily intravenously were low when co-administered with lopinavir/ritonavir but increased to recommended therapeutic levels with an increase of the voriconazole dose to 7 mg/kg twice daily. This case highlights the utility of voriconazole therapeutic drug monitoring when prescribed concurrently with a ritonavir boosted protease inhibitor and the potential role of combination therapy with IFN-G for refractory cryptococcal meningitis."
19862765,"Effects of obesity induced by high-fat diet on the pharmacokinetics of nelfinavir, a HIV protease inhibitor, in laboratory rats.","The effect of obesity induced by a high-fat diet on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of nelfinavir (NFV) was investigated, focusing on the change of distribution and elimination caused by dyslipidemia and hepatic steatosis.The plasma unbound fraction (f(u)) of NFV in obese rats (0.61+/-0.03%) was significantly lower than in the control (1.10+/-0.09%), caused by increasing the plasma triglyceride-rich lipoprotein level. After intravenous (i.v.) administration of NFV, the marked decrease of the distribution volume and slower total clearance (39.5% and 69.1% of the control, respectively) caused by the lower f(u) were the main reasons for the significantly higher area under the blood concentration versus time curve (AUC) in obese rats (145.3% of the control). The absorption of NFV after intraduodenal (i.d.) administration in obese rats was significantly greater than in the control (AUC; 170.4% of the control). The increased bile in obese rats was the main reason for the increasing absorption of NFV, and the lower expression of intestinal P-glycoprotein was also considered. On the other hand, although higher AUCs in obese rats were shown, unbound AUCs in the obese rats were slightly lower than in the control, namely, the plasma NFV concentration in obese rats to obtain the same pharmacological effect was higher than in the control, suggesting the difficulty of drug monitoring. These results suggest that it is necessary to pay further attention to therapeutic drug monitoring of NFV in patients manifesting metabolic syndrome, such as dyslipidemia and visceral fat accumulation, including hepatic steatosis."
19865000,"Validation of an electrospray ionization LC-MS/MS method for quantitative analysis of raltegravir, etravirine, and 9 other antiretroviral agents in human plasma samples.","BACKGROUND: Raltegravir is the first human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) integrase inhibitor used in treatment-experienced patients who have evidence of viral replication and HIV-1 strains resistance to multiple antiretroviral regimens. Etravirine is a novel NNRTI, active against HIV-1 strains harboring multiple NNRTI mutations. A liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed for the quantification of raltegravir, etravirine, and 9 other antiretroviral agents (amprenavir, atazanavir, darunavir, efavirenz, indinavir, lopinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, and tipranavir) in plasma at the concentrations associated with therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The ritonavir analog, methyl indinavir, and lopinavir-d8 were used as internal standards, added to 100 microL of plasma sample prior to a protein precipitation using methanol. Chromatographic separation was achieved on a C18 HPLC column (Waters Sunfire 100 x 2.1 mm, 3.5 microm) with a mobile phase gradient at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. Five microL of sample were injected into the LC-MS/MS system (Waters Quattro Premier XE) to determine concentrations of raltegravir, etravirine, and other antiretroviral agents. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: This method showed an excellent linearity for all calibration curves (r2 > 0.998). The lower limit of quantification was established at 5 ng/mL for raltegravir and 40 ng/mL for etravirine, with precision and accuracy within +/-20% and 80% to 120% for all analytes. Intraassay and interassay precision and inaccuracy ranged from -9.2% to 6.9% for raltegravir and from -14.3% to 12.3% for etravirine and were less than 15% for all other compounds. No matrix effect was observed for any of the antiretrovirals studied. CONCLUSION: A rapid, specific, and sensitive LC-MS/MS method for quantification of raltegravir, etravirine, and 9 other antiretrovirals in human plasma was developed and was successfully applied for routine therapeutic drug monitoring."
19929448,Abacavir and lamivudine combination.,"BACKGROUND: Fixed dose antiretroviral combinations (FDC) may improve therapy adherence with reduced pill burden. Abacavir and lamivudine are well-established nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors available as a once-daily FDC. Abacavir is currently considered an alternative treatment option in most established treatment guidelines based on associations with cardiovascular events and lesser efficacy in patients with higher baseline viremia. OBJECTIVE: To summarize rigorous clinical trial data and cohort studies that examine efficacy, safety and tolerability of the individual components and the FDC of abacavir-lamivudine. METHODS: Clinical trial data, post-marketing research findings and clinical cohort data were reviewed to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of the individual components and the FDC of abacavir-lamivudine along with recommendations from published clinical treatment guidelines. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: The efficacy of abacavir-lamivudine is well documented in numerous clinical studies and treatment guidelines. The introduction of laboratory testing to identify patients at risk for hypersensitivity has decreased the incidence of these reactions. Recent findings suggest that abacavir is an alternative treatment agent with baseline HIV RNA > 100,000 copies/ml. Data related to cardiovascular events associated with abacavir are conflicting. Hepatic function should be monitored closely in HIV/HBV co-infected patients who discontinue lamivudine-containing products as severe acute exacerbations of HBV have been reported."
19934385,Drug-drug interaction between itraconazole and the protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir.,"OBJECTIVE: To report the results of therapeutic drug monitoring of lopinavir/ritonavir and itraconazole concentrations in an HIV-infected male who was treated for histoplasmosis. CASE SUMMARY: A 34-year-old HIV-infected man who had recently initiated efavirenz-based antiretroviral therapy was diagnosed with disseminated Histoplasma capsulatum infection. In the hospital, lopinavir/ritonavir 400 mg/100 mg twice daily replaced efavirenz to avoid efavirenz-itraconazole interactions. After 14 days of liposomal amphotericin B therapy, itraconazole solution was initiated at 150 mg twice daily for 3 days, followed by 200 mg daily. Prior to itraconazole initiation, lopinavir trough concentration was 7.4 mg/L. The lopinavir trough concentration 15 days later, after 14 days of itraconazole, was 6.8 mg/L. An itraconazole concentration measured 2 hours post-dose on day 15 of oral therapy was 1.9 microg/mL. After 2 weeks of liposomal amphotericin, urine Histoplasma antigen was 27.23 ng/mL; after 5 months of oral itraconazole therapy, it decreased to 5.24 ng/mL. Plasma HIV RNA decreased 4.26 log(10) in 5 months to less than 40 copies/mL. The patient has demonstrated marked clinical improvement. DISCUSSION: In this case, dosing recommendations of itraconazole 200 mg daily with lopinavir/ritonavir were appropriate. Lopinavir trough concentrations were not significantly different following the addition of itraconazole and were above the minimum target of 1 mg/L in treatment-naive patients. The itraconazole concentration was above the recommended concentration of at least 1 microg/mL. CONCLUSIONS: The dose of itraconazole was reduced to 200 mg daily as recommended by current guidelines, and therapeutic drug monitoring of both itraconazole and lopinavir concentrations confirmed that no further dosage adjustments were necessary."
19940945,Strategies to optimize HIV treatment outcomes in resource-limited settings.,"Although the availability of antiretroviral therapy has increased rapidly to reach over three million people in low- and middle-income countries, coverage remains low as only 31% of people in need were receiving antiretroviral therapy in sub-Saharan Africa. Antiretroviral therapy scale-up needs to continue to grow exponentially to meet the need for universal access and keep pace with or exceed the new HIV infections. This calls for strategies that will have the greatest impact on the reduction of opportunistic infections, toxicities, and early mortality after antiretroviral therapy initiation as well improve adherence, clinical, immunological, and virologic responses, patient retention in antiretroviral therapy programs, and overall quality of life of people living with HIV/AIDS. Expanding antiretroviral therapy to all those eligible requires evidence-based decisions about how, when, and where expansion should occur. In this article we highlight some of the strategies that have optimized HIV treatment outcomes within the constraints of limited resources in sub-Saharan Africa. Key strategies to optimize HIV treatment outcomes include, i) scaling up HIV testing to identify all in need of HIV treatment, ii) strengthening the links between HIV diagnosis and comprehensive HIV/AIDS care, iii) timely initiation of antiretroviral therapy, iv) optimal diagnosis and treatment of opportunistic infections and comorbidities, v) investing in laboratory tests to support clinical monitoring of patients on antiretroviral therapy, vi) maximizing adherence to antiretroviral medication and retention of patients in HIV/AIDS care, viii) improving the health infrastructure, and increasing the human resources to handle the growing numbers of people in need of HIV treatment."
19940949,Understanding HIV phenotypic resistance testing: usefulness in managing treatment-experienced patients.,"This review discusses how ""virtual"" and conventional phenotypic assays establish clinical cutoffs predictive of response in HIV isolates from antiretroviral-experienced patients. Sophisticated phenotypic assays that incorporate linear regression modeling and conventional phenotypic assays have been used to define and validate clinical cutoffs (i.e. the correlation between viral susceptibility and treatment response) for most antiretrovirals, including the newer protease inhibitors. Using these clinical cutoff values, clinical data show that the newer protease inhibitors retain activity against the majority of isolates from treatment-experienced patients and from those with baseline resistance to multiple protease inhibitors. The utility of phenotypic resistance testing methods have therefore been validated in the clinical setting. In summary, HIV drug resistance testing is currently the recommended standard of care for the selection of antiretroviral regimens for HIV-infected patients in multiple clinical settings. An understanding of the basic principles of phenotypic resistance testing is crucial for providing optimal care, particularly for antiretroviral-experienced patients."
20004464,Routine versus clinically driven laboratory monitoring of HIV antiretroviral therapy in Africa (DART): a randomised non-inferiority trial.,"BACKGROUND: HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) is often managed without routine laboratory monitoring in Africa; however, the effect of this approach is unknown. This trial investigated whether routine toxicity and efficacy monitoring of HIV-infected patients receiving ART had an important long-term effect on clinical outcomes in Africa. METHODS: In this open, non-inferiority trial in three centres in Uganda and one in Zimbabwe, 3321 symptomatic, ART-naive, HIV-infected adults with CD4 counts less than 200 cells per microL starting ART were randomly assigned to laboratory and clinical monitoring (LCM; n=1659) or clinically driven monitoring (CDM; n=1662) by a computer-generated list. Haematology, biochemistry, and CD4-cell counts were done every 12 weeks. In the LCM group, results were available to clinicians; in the CDM group, results (apart from CD4-cell count) could be requested if clinically indicated and grade 4 toxicities were available. Participants switched to second-line ART after new or recurrent WHO stage 4 events in both groups, or CD4 count less than 100 cells per microL (LCM only). Co-primary endpoints were new WHO stage 4 HIV events or death, and serious adverse events. Non-inferiority was defined as the upper 95% confidence limit for the hazard ratio (HR) for new WHO stage 4 events or death being no greater than 1.18. Analyses were by intention to treat. This study is registered, number ISRCTN13968779. FINDINGS: Two participants assigned to CDM and three to LCM were excluded from analyses. 5-year survival was 87% (95% CI 85-88) in the CDM group and 90% (88-91) in the LCM group, and 122 (7%) and 112 (7%) participants, respectively, were lost to follow-up over median 4.9 years' follow-up. 459 (28%) participants receiving CDM versus 356 (21%) LCM had a new WHO stage 4 event or died (6.94 [95% CI 6.33-7.60] vs 5.24 [4.72-5.81] per 100 person-years; absolute difference 1.70 per 100 person-years [0.87-2.54]; HR 1.31 [1.14-1.51]; p=0.0001). Differences in disease progression occurred from the third year on ART, whereas higher rates of switch to second-line treatment occurred in LCM from the second year. 283 (17%) participants receiving CDM versus 260 (16%) LCM had a new serious adverse event (HR 1.12 [0.94-1.32]; p=0.19), with anaemia the most common (76 vs 61 cases). INTERPRETATION: ART can be delivered safely without routine laboratory monitoring for toxic effects, but differences in disease progression suggest a role for monitoring of CD4-cell count from the second year of ART to guide the switch to second-line treatment.

20035163,Mortality associated with discordant responses to antiretroviral therapy in resource-constrained settings.,"OBJECTIVES: We assessed mortality associated with immunologic and virologic patterns of response at 6 months of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in HIV-infected individuals from resource-limited countries in Africa and South America. METHODS: Patients who initiated HAART between 1996 and 2007, aged 16 years or older, and had at least 1 measurement (HIV-1 RNA plasma viral load or CD4 cell count) at 6 months of therapy (3-9 month window) were included. Therapy response was categorized as complete, discordant (virologic only or immunologic only), and absent. Associations between 6-month response to therapy and all-cause mortality were assessed by Cox proportional hazards regression. Robust standard errors were calculated to account for intrasite correlation. RESULTS: A total of 7160 patients, corresponding to 15,107 person-years, were analyzed. In multivariable analysis adjusted for age at HAART initiation, baseline clinical stage and CD4 cell count, year of HAART initiation, clinic, occurrence of an AIDS-defining condition within the first 6 months of treatment, and discordant and absent responses were associated with increased risk of death. CONCLUSIONS: Similar to reports from high-income countries, discordant immunologic and virologic responses were associated with intermediate risk of death compared with complete and no response in this large cohort of HIV-1 patients from resource-limited countries. Our results support a recommendation for wider availability of plasma viral load testing to monitor antiretroviral therapy in these settings."

20040897,Effect of nevirapine on the steady-state trough concentrations of atazanavir in HIV-infected patients receiving atazanavir/ritonavir.,"MATERIAL AND METHODS: To evaluate the influence of nevirapine on atazanavir trough concentrations (Ctrough) in a group of HIV-infected patients, we performed an open-label pilot study enrolling patients receiving 300/100 mg atazanavir/ritonavir once daily for 2 weeks or longer. Nevirapine was added at a dose of 200 mg once daily from Days 0 to 14 and 200 mg twice daily from Days 14 to 28. Atazanavir and nevirapine plasma Ctroughs were determined at Days 0 and 28. Atazanavir Ctroughs were compared between Days 0 and 28. Atazanavir and nevirapine Ctroughs at Day 28 were compared with historical controls receiving either 400 mg atazanavir once daily or 200 mg nevirapine twice daily. RESULTS: Fourteen patients were enrolled and 11 completed the study. The geometric mean (range) atazanavir Ctrough decreased from 0.631 mg/L (range, 0.235-1.87 mg/L) at Day 0 to 0.316 mg/L (range, 0.142-1.109 mg/L) at Day 28 to give a geometric mean ratio of 0.59 (95% confidence interval, 0.38-0.80; P = 0.026); nonetheless, the atazanavir Ctrough remained higher than the minimum effective concentration in 80% of the participants and higher than the median concentration in the control subjects receiving 400 mg atazanavir once daily without ritonavir (geometric mean ratio, 3.20; 95% confidence interval, 1.65-6.22; P = 0.001). The nevirapine Ctrough at Day 28 was slightly higher than in the historical controls on 200 mg nevirapine twice daily without atazanavir (geometric mean ratio, 1.46; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-2.06; P = 0.030). CONCLUSION: We conclude that coadministration of 300/100 mg atazanavir/ritonavir once daily plus 200 mg nevirapine twice daily was safe and well tolerated but resulted in a decrease of atazanavir Ctrough by nearly half. Therefore, monitoring atazanavir Ctrough is recommended in patients treated with this drug combination, and increasing the atazanavir dose might be necessary."
20040898,A validated high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet method for quantification of the CCR5 inhibitor maraviroc in plasma of HIV-infected patients.,"Maraviroc is the first commercialized CCR5 inhibitor for HIV therapy. A new high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet method to quantify maraviroc concentrations in human plasma was developed and validated. The method is based on a protein precipitation procedure, with an acidic solution of acetonitrile (trifluoroacetic acid 0.1%) and quinoxaline as internal standard. The analytes were eluted using a gradient run in 15 minutes on an analytical C18 Luna column (150 mm x 4.6 mm ID) with a particle size of 5 mum. Maraviroc and internal standard were detected by UV at 193 nm and 352 nm, respectively. The calibration curve was linear up to 2500 ng/mL. The mean recovery of maraviroc was 96%. All validation data were in accordance with U.S. Food and Drug Administration requirements. The new high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet method reported here could be used routinely to monitor plasma concentrations of maraviroc in healthy volunteers and HIV-infected patients."
20051929,"HIV protease inhibitors are substrates for OATP1A2, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 and lopinavir plasma concentrations are influenced by SLCO1B1 polymorphisms.","OBJECTIVE: OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 are major hepatic drug transporters whilst OATP1A2 is mainly located in the brain but is also located in liver and several other organs. These transporters affect the distribution and clearance of many endobiotics and xenobiotics and have been reported to have functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We have assessed the substrate specificities of these transporters for a panel of antiretrovirals and investigated the effects of SNPs within these transporters on the pharmacokinetics of lopinavir. METHODS: SLCO1A2, SLCO1B1 and SLCO1B3 were cloned, verified and used to generate cRNA for use in the Xenopuslaevis oocyte transport system. Using the oocyte system, antiretrovirals were tested for their substrate specificities. Plasma samples (n=349) from the Liverpool therapeutic drug monitoring registry were genotyped for SNPs in SLCO1A2, SLCO1B1 and SLCO1B3 and associations between SNPs and lopinavir plasma concentrations were analysed. RESULT: Antiretroviral protease inhibitors, but not non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, are substrates for OATP1A2, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. Furthermore, ritonavir was not an inhibitor of OATP1B1. The 521T>C polymorphism in SLCO1B1 was significantly associated with higher lopinavir plasma concentrations. No associations were observed with functional variants of SLCO1A2 and SLCO1B3. CONCLUSION: These data add to our understanding of the factors that contribute to variability in plasma concentrations of protease inhibitors. Further studies are now required to confirm the association of SLCO1B1 521T>C with lopinavir plasma concentrations and to assess the influence of other polymorphisms in the SLCO family."
20070407,Mid-dosing interval concentration of atazanavir and virological outcome in patients treated for HIV-1 infection.,"OBJECTIVES: We investigated the clinical significance of monitoring the mid-dosing interval atazanavir (ATV) concentration (measured 12 +/- 2 h after intake; C(12 h)) in patients taking this drug once daily in the evening. METHODS: We retrospectively selected HIV-infected patients harbouring ATV-susceptible virus who underwent therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of ATV C(12 h) during routine out-patient visits, and we correlated C(12 h) to the 24-week virological response and toxicity. RESULTS: A total of 115 plasma samples from 86 patients (76.7% with baseline HIV RNA<50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL) were analysed. ATV plasma concentrations showed high inter-individual variability. ATV plasma levels were higher in samples obtained from patients taking boosted regimens (P<0.001) and not concomitantly receiving acid-reducing agents (P=0.007). In a multivariate model, ritonavir boosting, use of acid-reducing agents and liver cirrhosis showed an independent association with ATV level. Virological response at 24 weeks was observed for 94 of the 115 samples (81.7%). We identified a concentration cut-off of 0.23 mg/L which predicted virological response at 24 weeks: samples with a C(12 h)< or =0.23 mg/L showed virological failure in 41.2% of cases, whereas samples with a C(12 h)>0.23 mg/L showed virological failure in 14.3% of cases (P=0.021). In multivariate analysis, C(12 h)>0.23 mg/L was an independent predictor of virological response [odds ratio (OR) 4.23, P=0.031]. ATV levels correlated with concomitant unconjugated bilirubin levels (r=0.223, P=0.037), but a concentration cut-off predictive of moderate/severe hyperbilirubinaemia could not be identified. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a C(12 h) efficacy threshold that predicted virological response; this could be useful for morning TDM in selected subjects receiving ATV in the evening. Results must be interpreted with caution given the retrospective design of the study."
20091340,Work-related barriers and facilitators to antiretroviral therapy adherence in persons living with HIV infection.,"Little is known about how the structure of work affects adherence to HIV antiretroviral therapy. We surveyed participants in an adherence intervention study to learn more about job characteristics, including measures of psychological demand and control, and job accommodations. Adherence was assessed using the Medication Event Monitoring System. Of 156 trial subjects, 69 were employed, and these 69 made 229 study visits. Psychological demands and control were unrelated to adherence, but the presence of workplace accommodations was significantly associated with adherence (P < 0.05). In multivariable models adjusting for clustering, those who reported having received an accommodation were 12% more adherent than those who did not receive an accommodation. Adherence was unrelated to experiencing side effects affecting work performance. Having the ability to institute job accommodations was more important to adherence than the psychosocial structure of the work. These potential benefits of requesting modifications need to be weighed against the possible risks of workplace disclosure."
20154024,Modelling response to HIV therapy without a genotype: an argument for viral load monitoring in resource-limited settings.,"In the absence of widespread access to individualized laboratory monitoring, which forms an integral part of HIV patient management in resource-rich settings, the roll-out of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in resource-limited settings has adopted a public health approach based on standard HAART protocols and clinical/immunological definitions of therapy failure. The cost-effectiveness of HIV-1 viral load monitoring at the individual level in such settings has been debated, and questions remain over the long-term and population-level impact of managing HAART without it. Computational models that accurately predict virological response to HAART using baseline data including CD4 count, viral load and genotypic resistance profile, as developed by the Resistance Database Initiative, have significant potential as an aid to treatment selection and optimization. Recently developed models have shown good predictive performance without the need for genotypic data, with viral load emerging as by far the most important variable. This finding provides further, indirect support for the use of viral load monitoring for the long-term optimization of HAART in resource-limited settings."
20181709,Antiretroviral therapy in the clinic.,"Antiretroviral therapy in the developed world has resulted in substantial reductions in HIV-associated morbidity and mortality, changing an HIV diagnosis from a likely death sentence into a manageable chronic infection (F. J. Palella, Jr., K. M. Delaney, A. C. Moorman, M. O. Loveless, J. Fuhrer, G. A. Satten, D. J. Aschman, and S. D. Holmberg, N. Engl. J. Med. 338:853-860, 1998). Several million years of life have been saved by effective anti-HIV treatment, although these successes should not obscure the magnitude of the ongoing worldwide HIV epidemic (R. P. Walensky, A. D. Paltiel, E. Losina, L. M. Mercincavage, B. R. Schackman, P. E. Sax, M. C. Weinstein, and K. A. Freedberg, J. Infect. Dis. 194:11-19, 2006). Readers of the Journal of Virology are doubtless aware of the fundamental advances in retrovirology that have made possible the development of potent inhibitors of HIV replication. In this review, we focus on the issues surrounding how these drugs and drug regimens are actually used in clinical settings. Their proper use requires detailed knowledge of the natural history of HIV infection, the pharmacology of the individual drugs, the complexities of drug-drug interactions, and the use of sophisticated molecular tests for monitoring of viral load, immunologic response, and drug resistance."
20184766,Regional differences in rates of HIV-1 viral load monitoring in Canada: Insights and implications for antiretroviral care in high income countries.,"BACKGROUND: Viral load (VL) monitoring is an essential component of the care of HIV positive individuals. Rates of VL monitoring have been shown to vary by HIV risk factor and clinical characteristics. The objective of this study was to determine whether there are differences among regions in Canada in the rates of VL testing of HIV-positive individuals on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), where the testing is available without financial barriers under the coverage of provincial health insurance programs. METHODS: The Canadian Observational Cohort (CANOC) is a collaboration of nine Canadian cohorts of HIV-positive individuals who initiated cART after January 1, 2000. The study included participants with at least one year of follow-up. Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) regression models were used to determine the effect of geographic region on (1) the occurrence of an interval of 9 months or more between two consecutive recorded VL tests and (2) the number of days between VL tests, after adjusting for demographic and clinical covariates. Overall and regional annual rates of VL testing were also reported. RESULTS: 3,648 individuals were included in the analysis with a median follow-up of 42.9 months and a median of 15 VL tests. In multivariable GEE logistic regression models, gaps in VL testing >9 months were more likely in Quebec (Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.72, p < 0.0001) and Ontario (OR = 1.78, p < 0.0001) than in British Columbia and among injection drug users (OR = 1.68, p < 0.0001) and were less likely among older individuals (OR = 0.77 per 10 years, p < 0.0001), among men having sex with men (OR = 0.62, p < 0.0001), within the first year of cART (OR = 0.15, p < 0.0001), among individuals on cART at the time of the blood draw (OR = 0.34, p < 0.0001) and among individuals with VL < 50 copies/ml at the previous visit (OR = 0.56, p < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Significant variation in rates of VL testing and the probability of a significant gap in testing were related to geographic region, HIV risk factor, age, year of cART initiation, type of cART regimen, being in the first year of cART, AIDS-defining illness and whether or not the previous VL was below the limit of detection."
20214755,WHO clinical criteria-based initiation of antiretroviral therapy: lessons from rural district hospitals in Cameroon with regard to 2009 revised WHO recommendations.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the proportion of patients infected with HIV with a CD4 count above 350 cells/mm(3) among those classified at WHO clinical stage 3 or 4 who initiated antiretroviral therapy in rural district hospitals in Cameroon to assess the 2009 revised WHO recommendations. METHODS: Cross-sectional study in nine rural district hospitals where the treatment initiation is based on the WHO clinical criteria. The proportion of patients who were classified at stage 3 or 4 and who had a CD4 count >350 cells/mm(3) was assessed. RESULTS: Of 458 patients included in 2006-2008 (women 70.5%; median age 37.0 years), 337 (73.6%) were classified at WHO clinical stage 3 and 121 (26.4%) at stage 4. Overall, 108 patients (23.6%) had a CD4 count >350 cells/mm(3). Of them, 94 patients (20.5%) were classified at WHO clinical stage 3, and 14 (3.1%) were classified at WHO clinical stage 4. CONCLUSION: The WHO clinical stages 3 and 4 were poorly correlated with the 'gold standard' of CD4 cell count. This study highlights the need to promote CD4 testing for assessing the patient eligibility."
20219765,An empirical approach to defining loss to follow-up among patients enrolled in antiretroviral treatment programs.,"In many programs providing antiretroviral therapy (ART), clinicians report substantial patient attrition; however, there are no consensus criteria for defining patient loss to follow-up (LTFU). Data on a multisite human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment cohort in Lusaka, Zambia, were used to determine an empirical ""days-late"" definition of LTFU among patients on ART. Cohort members were classified as either ""in care"" or LTFU as of December 31, 2007, according to a range of days-late intervals. The authors then looked forward in the database to determine which patients actually returned to care at any point over the following year. The interval that best minimized LTFU misclassification was described as ""best-performing."" Overall, 33,704 HIV-infected adults on ART were included. Nearly one-third (n = 10,196) were at least 1 day late for an appointment. The best-performing LTFU definition was 56 days after a missed visit, which had a sensitivity of 84.1% (95% confidence interval (CI): 83.2, 85.0), specificity of 97.5% (95% CI: 97.3, 97.7), and misclassification of 5.1% (95% CI: 4.8, 5.3). The 60-day threshold performed similarly well, with only a marginal difference (<0.1%) in misclassification. This analysis suggests that > or =60 days since the last appointment is a reasonable definition of LTFU. Standardization to empirically derived definitions of LTFU will permit more reliable comparisons within and across programs."

20335191,New directly acting antivirals for hepatitis C: potential for interaction with antiretrovirals.,"Recent advances in the development of agents that act specifically to inhibit hepatitis C virus (HCV) are set to fundamentally change the way that patients will be treated. New directly acting anti-HCV agents such as protease and polymerase inhibitors will initially be added to standard of care with pegylated interferon-alpha and ribavirin. However, future therapy is likely to constitute combinations of agents which act at distinct stages of viral replication and have differing resistance profiles. While directly acting anti-HCV agents will undoubtedly improve treatment outcomes, the introduction of combination therapy may not be without complications in some patient groups. HIV-positive patients who are receiving antiretrovirals (ARVs) are relatively highly represented among those with HCV infection, and are at high risk of drug-drug interactions (DDIs). As combination anti-HCV treatment gradually evolves to resemble anti-HIV therapy, it is essential to consider the increased potential for DDIs in patients receiving combination anti-HCV therapy, and particularly in HCV/HIV-co-infected individuals. Therapeutic drug monitoring is likely to play a role in the clinical management of such interactions."
20350281,Therapeutic drug monitoring in highly active antiretroviral therapy.,"IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: Despite the efficacy of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), a large proportion of patients living with HIV/AIDS on ART does not achieve or maintain adequate virological suppression. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) has been utilised to improve treatment outcomes of ART. AREAS COVERED IN THE REVIEW: The potential incorporation of TDM into the clinical HIV management is supported by the existing relationship between drug exposure and efficacy/toxicity, the high inter-patient variability pharmacokinetics, and the accurate, specific and rapid method for drug level determination. The current status of TDM in ART is reviewed in this article with discussions on its feasibility, potential use and limitations. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: Mounting evidence from clinical trials has indicated the potential use of TDM in reducing the rates of treatment failure and adverse effect, avoiding the drug interactions, and special populations, such as children, pregnant women and patients with co-infections. TDM may play an important role even in resource-limited settings, to safeguard expanded use of bioequivalent generic antiretroviral drugs and avoid drug interactions with traditional Chinese medicines. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: TDM is still in the centre of controversy in that several critical issues need to be addressed, such as limited adherence assessment, inappropriate response predictors, insufficient validation of target concentration windows and lack of the quality control of assay. The utility of TDM will remain experimental until more data are obtained from large clinical trials showing the benefit of TDM."

20445482,The role of therapeutic drug monitoring in pediatric HIV/AIDS.,"International guidelines do not recommend therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of HIV-infected children as a routine measurement as part of medical management. There are, however, several clinical scenarios in which TDM may be indicated. Underdosing may be one of the major risks, especially in younger children. No randomized controlled clinical trials have been conducted to assess the added value of TDM in HIV-infected children, making recommendations for TDM in children with HIV/AIDS merely based on expert opinion. There is a need for more descriptive studies on the usefulness of TDM in HIV-infected children to convince pediatricians worldwide to let more children benefit from TDM."
20445485,Can therapeutic drug monitoring improve pharmacotherapy of HIV infection in adolescents?,"Currently, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is not performed in the United States as part of routine clinical care of an HIV-infected adolescent patient. TDM is recommended to rule out subtherapeutic drug concentrations and to differentiate among malabsorption, drug interactions, poor adherence, or increased drug metabolism or clearance as possible causes of decreased drug exposure. The use of TDM is also considered to assist in finding the optimal dose of a drug in patients whose virus has shown reduced susceptibility to that drug. The dosing of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs in adolescent patients with HIV infection depends on the chronologic age, weight, height, and the stage of sexual maturation. As a result of the limited data on the pharmacokinetics of ART during puberty, the transition of a dosing regimen from higher pediatric (weight and surface-based) to adult (fixed) range is not well defined. Developmental pharmacokinetic differences contribute to high variability in pediatric and adolescent patients and an increased frequency of suboptimal ARV exposure as compared to in adults. Individualized, concentration-targeted optimal dosing of ARV medications can be beneficial to patients for whom only limited dosing guidelines are available. This article describes three cases of the application of TDM in treatment-experienced adolescent patients whose ART was optimized using ARV TDM. TDM of ARV drugs is useful in managing the pharmacotherapy of HIV in adolescent patients and is well received by the adolescent patients with HIV and their families. Among others, the benefits of TDM provide evidence for adherence interventions and create grounds for enhanced education of the adolescent patient and involved adult caregivers about ART. Finally, TDM in adolescents provides valuable information about the clinical pharmacology of ART during puberty."
20466851,Low-frequency HIV-1 drug resistance mutations can be clinically significant but must be interpreted with caution.,"With drug-resistant HIV-1 present in at least 10%-20% of new infections in Western countries and in >60% of patients failing antiretroviral therapy (ART), monitoring HIV-1 drug resistance is becoming increasingly important for assessing its impact on therapeutic measures of virus control and for guiding treatment. The sensitivity limitations of conventional bulk genotyping often lead to an underestimation of the total burden of drug resistance in a patient, as resistant variants escape detection when present at low frequency within the viral quasispecies. Using sensitive resistance testing methods, a few investigators have linked low-frequency mutations to poor treatment outcomes, while other studies have shown no correlation. Understanding the technical limitations of sensitive testing methods and the relevance of the amount of a particular resistance mutation in the context of different ART regimens will help to define the clinical benefit of low-frequency resistance testing. Paramount to interpreting the clinical utility of sensitive testing is evaluating resistance mutations selectively, at biologically significant frequencies, and using methods that have been broadly validated on clinical specimens."
20499290,"Monitoring antiretroviral therapy in resource-limited settings: balancing clinical care, technology, and human resources.","Due to the rapid expansion of first-line antiretroviral therapy in resource-limited settings (RLS), increasing numbers of people are living with HIV for prolonged periods of time. Treatment programs must now decide how to balance monitoring costs necessary to maximize health benefits for those already on treatment with the continued demand to initiate more patients on first-line treatment. We review currently available evidence related to monitoring strategies in RLS and discuss their implications on timing of switching to second-line treatment, development of HIV resistance, and clinical outcome."
20508547,"Drug resistance in human immunodeficiency virus type-1 infected Zambian children using adult fixed dose combination stavudine, lamivudine, and nevirapine.","BACKGROUND: There are few medium-term virologic data in children from resource-limited settings taking adult fixed-dose-combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) without viral load monitoring. METHODS: CHAP2 (Children with HIV Antibiotic Prophylaxis 2) is a prospective cohort of Zambian children using d4T/3TC/NVP adult Triomune30 dosed according to WHO guidelines. RESULTS: A total of 103 children (19 with previous antiretroviral therapy) had follow-up >6 months. Median age at cART initiation was 8 years (IQR, 6-12) and CD4 8% (4-12). At 24 months, CD4% had increased by a median of 15% (7-25). For 74 children viral load was known/inferred: 51 of 74 (69%) had viral load <50 copies/mL (45 of 63 [71%] with no previous cART, 6 of 11 [55%] with previous cART; difference P = 0.30); 22 of 74 (30%) had viral load >1000 copies/mL. Of 26 children with resistance data, 25 (96%) had NNRTI resistance; 22 (84%) had M184V; 2 (8%) had Q151M; and 1 (4%) each had K65R, L74V, or K70E. Eight (31%) had > or =1 TAM. Those failing virologically with a genotypic sensitivity score of 0 for first-line therapy had a somewhat smaller increase in CD4% from baseline compared with those failing therapy with a genotypic sensitivity score >0 (+3 vs. +8, P = 0.13), and had somewhat lower CD4% at initiation of cART (2 vs. 11, P = 0.09). In 6 children with >1 resistance test, the estimated rate of accumulation of TAMs was 0.59/yr (95% confidence interval: 0.22-1.29). CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-four month virologic responses to cART were good. However, the rate of TAM accumulation in those with rebound was higher than reported in Western adult cohorts, and there was some indication of a detrimental effect of high level resistance on CD4% change from baseline."
20539078,Economic evaluation of ART in resource-limited countries.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In the face of increasing economic constraints, it is critically important to evaluate how best to utilize available resources. In this article, we review the growing number of cost-effectiveness analyses of HIV treatment with antiretroviral therapy (ART) in resource-limited settings. We focus on studies that evaluate when to start therapy, what therapy to start with and what to switch to based on what criteria. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent findings show that earlier ART initiation based on CD4 cell count criteria (CD4 cell counts <350 cells/microl) can be cost effective in most resource-limited settings. They also suggest that initiating ART with tenofovir as a component of the first-line regimen is an efficient use of resources compared with initiating ART with stavudine. Finally, they show that HIV RNA monitoring combined with CD4 monitoring is more effective than CD4 monitoring alone, although this strategy was not yet found to be cost effective in all studies. Nearly all studies demonstrate, however, that the cost-effectiveness ratio of HIV RNA monitoring will become more attractive as the cost of HIV RNA tests and second-line ART regimens decrease. SUMMARY: Substantial research shows that ART for HIV disease in resource-limited settings is cost effective. Improved initial regimens and increased laboratory monitoring may provide both clinical benefit and good value for money. Further price reductions of laboratory tests and recent antiretroviral drugs are needed to guarantee the cost-effectiveness of these required improvements."
20557927,Nurse versus doctor management of HIV-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy (CIPRA-SA): a randomised non-inferiority trial.,"BACKGROUND: Expanded access to combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) in resource-poor settings is dependent on task shifting from doctors to other health-care providers. We compared outcomes of nurse versus doctor management of ART care for HIV-infected patients. METHODS: This randomised non-inferiority trial was undertaken at two South African primary-care clinics. HIV-positive individuals with a CD4 cell count of less than 350 cells per microL or WHO stage 3 or 4 disease were randomly assigned to nurse-monitored or doctor-monitored ART care. Patients were randomly assigned by stratified permuted block randomisation, and neither the patients nor those analysing the data were masked to assignment. The primary objective was a composite endpoint of treatment-limiting events, incorporating mortality, viral failure, treatment-limiting toxic effects, and adherence to visit schedule. Analysis was by intention to treat. Non-inferiority of the nurse versus doctor group for cumulative treatment failure was prespecified as an upper 95% CI for the hazard ratio that was less than 1.40. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00255840. FINDINGS: 408 patients were assigned to doctor-monitored ART care and 404 to nurse-monitored ART care; all participants were analysed. 371 (46%) patients reached an endpoint of treatment failure: 192 (48%) in the nurse group and 179 (44%) in the doctor group. The hazard ratio for composite failure was 1.09 (95% CI 0.89-1.33), which was within the limits for non-inferiority. After a median follow-up of 120 weeks (IQR 60-144), deaths (ten vs 11), virological failures (44 vs 39), toxicity failures (68 vs 66), and programme losses (70 vs 63) were similar in nurse and doctor groups, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Nurse-monitored ART is non-inferior to doctor-monitored therapy. Findings from this study lend support to task shifting to appropriately trained nurses for monitoring of ART.

20572760,Evaluation of plasma human herpesvirus 8 DNA as a marker of clinical outcomes during antiretroviral therapy for AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma in Zimbabwe.,"BACKGROUND: The usefulness of plasma human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) DNA as a marker of response to treatment for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-associated Kaposi sarcoma (AIDS-KS) in an African setting is unknown. METHODS: We conducted a prospective pilot study at the Parirenyatwa Hospital Kaposi Sarcoma Clinic (Harare, Zimbabwe) to investigate the hypothesis that the clinical response of AIDS-KS is associated with suppression of HHV-8 DNA. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) was provided as coformulation of abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine. Clinical response was defined as survival to week 96 with either complete or partial resolution of KS disease. RESULTS: Ninety ART-naive participants (62 men and 28 women) aged >18 years who had human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and biopsy-confirmed KS were studied; 82% had stage T1 disease. Fifty participants received adjunctive chemotherapy. The median CD4(+) lymphocyte count increased from 124 cells/microL at baseline to 281 cells/microL, the plasma HIV-1 RNA level decreased from 4.69 to <2.60 log(10) copies/mL, the plasma HHV-8 DNA level decreased from 660 to <25 copies/mL, and HHV-8 DNA level in peripheral blood mononuclear cells decreased from 2790 to 37 copies/10(6) cells (P < .001 for each comparison). There were 14 deaths (16%) and 13 patients (15%) lost to follow-up. The most common cause of death was infection. Clinical response of KS occurred in 17 participants (19%). Pretreatment plasma HHV-8 DNA levels of <660 copies/mL were associated with greater survival (odds ratio, 2.83; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-7.53; P = .04) and a better clinical response (odds ratio, 6.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.68-24.19; P = .006). CONCLUSIONS: AIDS-KS tumor responses after ART initiation were limited. Pretreatment plasma HHV-8 DNA level may be a surrogate for KS disease that is in need of intensive clinical management."
20592644,Quality assessment for therapeutic drug monitoring in AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG 5146): a multicenter clinical trial.,"In a randomized trial, AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) protocol 5146 (A5146) investigated the use of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) to adjust doses of HIV-1 protease inhibitors (PIs) in patients with prior virologic failure on PI-based therapy who were starting a new PI-based regimen. The overall percentage of ""PI trough repeats"" such as rescheduled visits or redrawn PI trough specimens increased from 2% to 5% to 10% as the process progressed from the clinical sites, the pharmacology specialty laboratory, and the study team, respectively. Cumulatively, this represents a 17% rate of failure to obtain adequate PI trough sample. While targeting a turnaround of 7 days or less from sample receipt to a drug concentration report, 12% of the received specimens required a longer period to report concentrations. The implementation of dosing changes in the TDM arm were achieved within 7 days or less for 56% of the dose change events and within 14 days or less for 77% of dose change events. This quality assurance analysis provides a valuable summary of the specific points in the TDM process that could be improved during a multicenter clinical trial including: 1) shortening the timeline of sample shipment from clinical site to the laboratory; 2) performing the collection of PI trough specimen within the targeted sampling window by careful monitoring of the last dose times and collection times by the clinicians; 3) increasing patient adherence counseling to reduce the number of samples that are redrawn due to suspecting inconsistent adherence; and 4) decreasing the time to successful TDM-based dose adjustment. The application of some of these findings may also be relevant to single-center studies or clinical TDM programs within a hospital."
20599871,The current role of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in therapeutic drug monitoring of immunosuppressant and antiretroviral drugs.,"Therapeutic drug monitoring of critical dose immunosuppressant drugs is established clinical practice and there are similar good reasons to monitor antiretrovirals. The aim of this article is to review the recent literature (last five years), with particular reference to the use of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). LC-MS/MS offers many potential advantages. The superior selectivity of LC-MS/MS over immunoassays for immunosuppressant drugs has been widely reported. Simultaneous measurement of a number of drugs can be performed. It is currently routine practice for the four major immunosuppressants (cyclosporin, tacrolimus, sirolimus and everolimus) to be simultaneously measured in whole blood. While up to 17 antiretroviral drugs have been simultaneously measured in plasma. The exquisite sensitivity of LC-MS/MS also provides the opportunity to measure these drugs in alternative matrices, such as dried blood spots, saliva, peripheral blood mononuclear cells and tissue. However, the clinical utility of measuring these classes of drugs in alternative matrices is still to be determined."
20632164,Ultrafast and high-throughput mass spectrometric assay for therapeutic drug monitoring of antiretroviral drugs in pediatric HIV-1 infection applying dried blood spots.,"Kaletra (Abott Laboratories) is a co-formulated medication used in the treatment of HIV-1-infected children, and it contains the two antiretroviral protease inhibitor drugs lopinavir and ritonavir. We validated two new ultrafast and high-throughput mass spectrometric assays to be used for therapeutic drug monitoring of lopinavir and ritonavir concentrations in whole blood and in plasma from HIV-1-infected children. Whole blood was blotted onto dried blood spot (DBS) collecting cards, and plasma was collected simultaneously. DBS collecting cards were extracted by an acetonitrile/water mixture while plasma samples were deproteinized with acetone. Drug concentrations were determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-QqQ-MS/MS). The application of DBS made it possible to measure lopinavir and ritonavir in whole blood in therapeutically relevant concentrations. The MALDI-QqQ-MS/MS plasma assay was successfully cross-validated with a commonly used high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-ultraviolet (UV) assay for the therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of HIV-1-infected patients, and it showed comparable performance characteristics. Observed DBS concentrations showed as well, a good correlation between plasma concentrations obtained by MALDI-QqQ-MS/MS and those obtained by the HPLC-UV assay. Application of DBS for TDM proved to be a good alternative to the normally used plasma screening. Moreover, collection of DBS requires small amounts of whole blood which can be easily performed especially in (very) young children where collection of large whole blood amounts is often not possible. DBS is perfectly suited for TDM of HIV-1-infected children; but nevertheless, DBS can also easily be applied for TDM of patients in areas with limited or no laboratory facilities."
20658830,Electronic monitoring-based counseling to enhance adherence among HIV-infected patients: a randomized controlled trial.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigated the effectiveness of an adherence intervention (AIMS) designed to fit HIV-clinics\' routine care procedures. DESIGN: Through block randomization, patients were allocated to the intervention or control group. The study included 2 months baseline measurement, 3 months intervention, and 4 months follow-up. HIV-nurses delivered a minimal intervention (""adherence sustaining"") to patients scoring >95% adherence at baseline, and an intensive intervention (""adherence improving"") to patients with <95% adherence. Control participants received high-quality usual care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Electronically monitored adherence and viral load. RESULTS: 133 patients were included (67 control, 66 intervention), 60% had <95% adherence at baseline, and 87% (116/133) completed the trial. Intent-to-treat analyses showed that adherence improved significantly in the complete intervention sample. Subgroup analyses showed that this effect was caused by participants scoring <95% at baseline (mean difference = 15.20%; p < .001). These effects remained stable during follow-up. The number of patients with an undetectable viral load increased in the intervention group compared to the control group (OR = 2.96, p < .05). Treatments effects on viral load were mediated by the improvements in adherence. CONCLUSIONS: The AIMS-intervention was effective and can be integrated in routine clinical care for HIV-infected patients. Future research should study its (cost)effectiveness among more heterogeneous samples and in settings with variable levels of standard care."
20679511,A retrospective evaluation of pretreatment and follow-up monitoring of HIV-infected adult patients in a resource-poor setting.,"The rapid scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is associated with the challenges of ensuring that HIV care delivered to clients is of the highest quality. This study was designed to evaluate the pretreatment and 12 month follow-up monitoring of clinical and laboratory profiles of HIV-infected patients at the adult HIV clinic of the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital, in Nigeria. It was a retrospective analysis of records of 440 adult patients who were on follow-up visits for 1 or more years. Two hundred two (45.9%) were male and 238 (54.1%) were female. Weight was documented at baseline in 314 (71.4%) and at month 12 of follow-up in 258 (58.6%). Baseline World Health Organization (WHO) clinical stage was documented in 269 (61.1%). Baseline CD4 count, full blood count (FBC), creatinine (Cr), liver function tests (LFT), fasting blood sugar (FBS), and fasting serum lipids (FSL) were documented in 243 (55.6%), 260 (59.1%), 143 (32.5%), 136 (30.9%), 268 (60.9%), and 161 (36.6%), respectively. At 12th month of follow-up visit, the CD4 count, FBC, Cr, LFT, FBS, and FSL were documented in 121 (27.5%), 94 (21.4%), 59 (13.4%), 77 (17.5%), 179 (40.7%), and 95 (21.6%), respectively. This report shows that the pretreatment and the 12th-month follow-up monitoring of HIV-infected adult patients in our center was less than optimal. We recommend periodic self-assessment by care providers to monitor compliance with standards."
20720517,The convergence of therapeutic drug monitoring and pharmacogenetic testing to optimize efavirenz therapy.,"The aim of this study was to show the benefits of combining therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) and pharmacogenetic analyses to optimize efavirenz (EFV) therapy. Patients were selected to minimize nongenetic differences between patients: 32 HIV adherent patients without drug interactions treated with an EFV nonindividualized dose over at least 1 year and included in a TDM program were genotyped according to minimum steady-state concentrations (C ss min). The EFV plasma concentrations (n = 158) were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet, and genetic polymorphisms were analyzed using the PHARMAchip. Central nervous system side effects were assessed systematically. Genetic polymorphisms were detected in 79.2% of patients with EFV Css min outside the therapeutic range (1-4 mg/L), showing the high diagnostic efficacy of combining TDM with pharmacogenetic testing. CYP2B6 (516 G>T) polymorphisms were associated with a significant decrease in EFV plasma clearance in 80% of the poor metabolizer patients (G/T, T/T). All homozygous patients had C ss min greater than 4 mg/L, 75% of them showing central nervous system side effects. For such patients, pharmacogenetic testing with TDM could be advantageous because the polymorphism is a determinant of these circumstances and TDM would allow reductions in dose to be specified without assuming an equal dose for any given genotype. In fact, poor metabolizer patients required less than a 600 mg standard starting dose, implying that if CYP2B6 screening were available, EFV therapy could be started at 400 mg and later TDM-individualized. The results of this study clarify the genotype versus phenotype debate for optimizing drug therapy. Pharmacogenetic testing together with TDM links genotype to phenotypic differences in drug concentrations and adverse events, providing additional support for dosage adjustment and a more efficient use of both approaches. As genotype screens become cheaper, and in combination with TDM, adjusting dosages in the light of genetic polymorphisms will become a reality."
20726906,Therapeutic drug monitoring of lopinavir/ritonavir in pregnancy.,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to determine total and unbound lopinavir (LPV) plasma concentrations in HIV-infected pregnant women receiving lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r tablet) undergoing therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) during pregnancy and postpartum. METHODS: Women were enrolled in the study who were receiving the LPV/r tablet as part of their routine prenatal care. Demographic and clinical data were collected and LPV plasma (total) and ultrafiltrate (unbound) concentrations were determined in the first, second and third trimesters using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). Postpartum sampling was performed where applicable. Antepartum and postpartum trough concentrations (C(trough) ) were compared independently [using analysis of variance (anova)] and on a longitudinal basis (using a paired t-test). RESULTS: Forty-six women were enrolled in the study (38 Black African). Forty women initiated LPV/r treatment in pregnancy. Median (range) gestation at initiation was 25 (15-36) weeks and median (range) baseline CD4 count and viral load were 346 (14-836) cells/muL and 8724 (<50-267408) HIV-1 RNA copies/mL, respectively. Forty women (87%) had LPV concentrations above the accepted minimum effective concentration for wild-type virus (MEC; 1000 ng/mL). Geometric mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) total LPV concentrations in the first/second [3525 (2823-4227) ng/mL; n=16] and third [3346 (2813-3880) ng/mL; n=43] trimesters were significantly lower relative to postpartum [5136 (3693-6579) ng/mL; n=12] (P=0.006). In a paired analysis (n=12), LPV concentrations were reduced in the third trimester [3657 (2851-4463) ng/mL] vs. postpartum (P=0.021). No significant differences were observed in the LPV fraction unbound (fu%). Conclusions The above target concentrations achieved in the majority of women and similarities in the fu% suggest standard dosing of the LPV/r tablet is appropriate during pregnancy. However, reduced LPV concentrations in the second/third trimesters and potentially compromised adherence highlight the need for TDM-guided dose adjustment in certain cases."

20731678,The use of human immunodeficiency virus resistance tests in clinical practice.,"Important progress has been made in recent years in the development and clinical use of drugs for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Nevertheless, when antiretroviral therapy fails to be fully suppressive, new viral variants emerge, thus allowing HIV-1 to escape from drug pressure by accumulating mutations. Between 50% and 70% of treated patients with virological rebound harbour some form of drug-resistant virus; transmitted drug resistance in drug-naive populations has reached 5-20% in areas of the world with access to treatment. The emergence of drug-resistant viruses remains the limiting factor in HIV-1 management, being a major cause of treatment failure, and being associated with clinical progression and death. All international guidelines focus on the importance of tailoring antiretroviral therapy to the individual patient, on the basis onf HIV-1 genetic data, integrated with clinical, laboratory and therapeutic information. The aim of this review is to provide useful information to clinicians and virologists about how and when to use genotypic resistance testing in clinical practice, especially in the management of the first stages of HIV-1 patient care and treatment decisions."
20847524,Development and application of a simple LC-MS method for the determination of plasma maraviroc concentrations.,"Maraviroc is an orally available antagonist of the CCR5 chemokine receptor, which acts as a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) coreceptor. Binding of maraviroc to this receptor blocks HIV-1 attachment to the coreceptor and prevents HIV-1 from entering host cells. Maraviroc does not require intracellular processing to exert this activity. Drug interaction studies have shown changes in maraviroc exposure when given with other anti-HIV medications, and thus quantification of maraviroc in human plasma is important to manage drug interactions and to evaluate the relationship between plasma concentrations and treatment response. We developed a conventional LC-MS method for determining plasma maraviroc concentrations, validated by estimating precision and accuracy for inter- and intraday analysis in the concentration range of 0.011-2.188 microg/ml. The calibration curve was linear within this range. The average accuracy ranged from 92.7% to 99.7%, while the relative standard deviations of both inter- and intraday assays were less than 7.1%. Recovery of maraviroc exceeded 86.7%. Our LC-MS method provides a conventional, accurate and precise way to determine the maraviroc concentration in human plasma. This method enables dose adjustment based on monitoring plasma maraviroc concentrations and permits management of drug interactions and toxicity."

20926993,Exposure-related effects of atazanavir on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir in HIV-1-infected patients.,"Raltegravir (RAL) is primarily metabolized by uridine diphosphate-glucorunosyl transferase 1A1 (UGT1A1). Atazanavir (ATV), a strong inhibitor of UGT1A1, has been shown to increase plasma concentrations of RAL by approximately 50% in healthy volunteers. However, the extent of this interaction has not been studied in HIV-infected patients. A pharmacokinetic study was performed in 22 HIV-infected adults treated with 400 mg RAL plus 300 mg ATV 300 twice a day. Both drugs showed high pharmacokinetic variability (RAL AUC 0-12 7649 +- 4862 ng*h/mL; ATV AUC 0-12 = 19237 +- 13136 ng*h/mL). Notably, RAL trough concentrations were significantly higher compared with those measured in HIV subjects (n = 24) on RAL plus nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (506 +- 411 versus 177 +- 262 ng/mL, P < 0.01). A significant correlation was found between RAL and ATV area under the curve (AUC) (r = 0.611, P = 0.005). Notably, patients with ATV AUC 0-12 above the mean or with concentrations exceeding the half maximal inhibitory concentration for UGT1A1 had twofold higher RAL AUCs compared with patients with lower ATV exposure. Coadministration of ATV significantly increased plasma concentrations of RAL, especially in HIV-1-infected patients exposed to high concentrations of the protease inhibitor. This pharmacokinetic drug interaction could be handled by routine measurements of ATV trough concentrations and by the assessment of plasma RAL concentrations 2 to 3 hours after the morning drug intake."
20953692,Standard measures are inadequate to monitor pediatric adherence in a resource-limited setting.,"This study aims to compare the use and cost of objective and subjective measures of adherence to pediatric antiretroviral treatment in a primary care facility in South Africa. In a 1-month longitudinal study of 53 caregiver-child dyads, pharmacy refill (PR), measurement of returned syrups (RS), caregiver self-report (3DR) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) were compared to Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS). Adherence was 100% for both VAS and 3DR; by PR and RS 100% and 103%, respectively. MEMS showed that 92% of prescribed doses were administered, but only 66% of these within the correct 12-hourly interval. None of the four measures correlated significantly with MEMS. MEMS data suggest that timing of doses is often more deviant from prescribed than expected and should be better addressed when monitoring adherence. Of all, MEMS was by far the most expensive measure. Alternative, cheaper electronic devices need to be more accessible in resource-limited settings."
20957423,"A preliminary randomized controlled trial of a nurse-delivered medication adherence intervention among HIV-positive outpatients initiating antiretroviral therapy in Beijing, China.","We evaluated a nurse-delivered adherence intervention in a preliminary randomized controlled trial among 70 HIV-positive outpatients initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Beijing, China. In both arms, participants received a 30-min educational session, a pillbox, and a referral to a peer support group. In the enhanced arm, participants could choose an electronic reminder device, three sessions of counseling either alone or with a treatment adherence partner, or both reminder and counseling. Survey assessments and blood draws occurred at baseline, post-intervention (13 weeks), and follow-up (25 weeks). Primary outcomes were 7-day and 30-day adherence assessed by self-report and electronic drug monitoring (EDM), and secondary outcomes were HIV-1 RNA viral load and CD4 count. The intervention was feasible and well received. It led to some improvement in self-reported and EDM-assessed adherence but not the biological outcomes. Providing counseling and facilitating the use of electronic reminders to patients initiating ART merits further investigation as a culturally viable means of promoting adherence in China."
21039218,"Viral load predicts new world health organization stage 3 and 4 events in HIV-infected children receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy, independent of CD4 T lymphocyte value.","BACKGROUND: Many resource-limited countries rely on clinical and immunological monitoring without routine virological monitoring for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected children receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). We assessed whether HIV load had independent predictive value in the presence of immunological and clinical data for the occurrence of new World Health Organization (WHO) stage 3 or 4 events (hereafter, WHO events) among HIV-infected children receiving HAART in Latin America. METHODS: The NISDI (Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development International Site Development Initiative) Pediatric Protocol is an observational cohort study designed to describe HIV-related outcomes among infected children. Eligibility criteria for this analysis included perinatal infection, age <15 years, and continuous HAART for >=6 months. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to assess time to new WHO events as a function of immunological status, viral load, hemoglobin level, and potential confounding variables; laboratory tests repeated during the study were treated as time-varying predictors. RESULTS: The mean duration of follow-up was 2.5 years; new WHO events occurred in 92 (15.8%) of 584 children. In proportional hazards modeling, most recent viral load >5000 copies/mL was associated with a nearly doubled risk of developing a WHO event (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.81; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-3.11; P = .033), even after adjustment for immunological status defined on the basis of CD4 T lymphocyte value, hemoglobin level, age, and body mass index. CONCLUSIONS: Routine virological monitoring using the WHO virological failure threshold of 5000 copies/mL adds independent predictive value to immunological and clinical assessments for identification of children receiving HAART who are at risk for significant HIV-related illness. To provide optimal care, periodic virological monitoring should be considered for all settings that provide HAART to children."
21054866,"Cost analysis of centralized viral load testing for antiretroviral therapy monitoring in Nicaragua, a low-HIV prevalence, low-resource setting.","BACKGROUND: HIV viral load testing as a component of antiretroviral therapy monitoring is costly. Understanding the full costs and the major sources of inefficiency associated with viral load testing is critical for optimizing the systems and technologies that support the testing process. The objective of our study was to estimate the costs associated with viral load testing performed for antiretroviral therapy monitoring to both patients and the public healthcare system in a low-HIV prevalence, low-resource country. METHODS: A detailed cost analysis was performed to understand the costs involved in each step of performing a viral load test in Nicaragua, from initial specimen collection to communication of the test results to each patient's healthcare provider. Data were compiled and cross referenced from multiple information sources: laboratory records, regional surveillance centre records, and scheduled interviews with the key healthcare providers responsible for HIV patient care in five regions of the country. RESULTS: The total average cost of performing a viral load test in Nicaragua varied by region, ranging from US$99.01 to US$124.58, the majority of which was at the laboratory level: $88.73 to $97.15 per specimen, depending on batch size. The average cost to clinics at which specimens were collected ranged from $3.31 to $20.92, depending on the region. The average cost per patient for transportation, food, lodging and lost income ranged from $3.70 to $14.93. CONCLUSIONS: The quantitative viral load test remains the single most expensive component of the process. For the patient, the distance of his or her residence from the specimen collection site is a large determinant of cost. Importantly, the efficiency of results reporting has a large impact on the cost per result delivered to the clinician and utility of the result for patient monitoring. Detailed cost analysis can identify opportunities for removing barriers to effective antiretroviral therapy monitoring programmes in limited-resource countries with low HIV prevalence."
21071165,A HPLC-MS method for the simultaneous quantification of fourteen antiretroviral agents in peripheral blood mononuclear cell of HIV infected patients optimized using medium corpuscular volume evaluation.,"A sensitive and accurate high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometric (HPLC-MS) method for the intracellular determination of 14 antiretroviral drugs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for HIV+ patients was validated. PBMCs are isolated by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation and cells count and the relative mean volume is performed with a Coulter( ) instrument. Extraction of drugs from PBMCs pellets was obtained with methanol:water (70:30, v/v), with quinoxaline added as internal standard, after a sonication step. Supernatant was dried and then dissolved in water/acetonitrile (60/40, v/v), before injection into a 2.1 mmx150 mm Atlantis( ) T3 3mu column. Chromatographic separations were performed using a gradient program with a mixture of water (0.05% formic acid), as mobile phase A and acetonitrile (0.05% formic acid), as mobile phase B. Analytes quantification was performed by electro-spray ionisation-single quadrupole mass spectrometry using the selected ion recording (SIR) detection mode. The positive ionization was used for the HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) indinavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, nelfinavir M8 metabolite, amprenavir, darunavir, atazanavir, ritonavir, lopinavir, tipranavir, the integrase inhibitor (II) raltegravir and the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) nevirapine and etravirine, while the negative ionization is applied for efavirenz. The calibration curves were built using blank PBMCs spiked with antiretroviral drugs at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 32 ng/mL (1-320 ng/mL for tipranavir) and fitted to a quadratic regression model weighted by 1/X. The mean extraction recovery for all PIs, II and NNRTIs was always above 82%. The method was precise, with a range of intra/inter-day percent standard deviation within 2.6-14.8%, and accurate with mean of percent coefficient of variation (CV%) from nominal values -7.85 to +9.7%. Each drug concentration evaluated was expressed in ng/mL and optimized using each patient medium corpuscolar volume and cell number. This analytical method is routinely used in our clinical research center for the assessment of intracellular levels of all PIs, raltegravir and NNRTIs commercially available at present."
21083497,Dried blood spots in HIV monitoring: applications in resource-limited settings.,"By the end of 2008, 4 million people were receiving antiretroviral treatment for HIV/AIDS in low- and middle-income countries. In industrialized countries, monitoring of treatment with viral load measurements and drug resistance testing is the standard of care to ensure early detection of treatment failure and a prompt switch to a fully active second-line regimen, before drug-resistant mutations accumulate. These tests, however, require highly specialized laboratories and stringent procedures for storage and shipment of plasma, and are rarely available in resource-limited settings. Therefore, treatment failure in such settings is usually not detected until patients develop severe immunodeficiency, at which stage widespread resistance is likely. Dried blood spots (DBS) are easy to collect and store, and can be a convenient alternative to plasma in settings with limited laboratory capacity. This review provides an overview of possible applications of DBS technologies in the monitoring of HIV treatment, with the main focus on viral load quantification and drug resistance testing."
21107266,Virologic failure and second-line antiretroviral therapy in children in South Africa--the IeDEA Southern Africa collaboration.,"BACKGROUND: With expanding pediatric antiretroviral therapy (ART) access, children will begin to experience treatment failure and require second-line therapy. We evaluated the probability and determinants of virologic failure and switching in children in South Africa. METHODS: Pooled analysis of routine individual data from children who initiated ART in 7 South African treatment programs with 6-monthly viral load and CD4 monitoring produced Kaplan-Meier estimates of probability of virologic failure (2 consecutive unsuppressed viral loads with the second being >1000 copies/mL, after >=24 weeks of therapy) and switch to second-line. Cox-proportional hazards models stratified by program were used to determine predictors of these outcomes. RESULTS: The 3-year probability of virologic failure among 5485 children was 19.3% (95% confidence interval: 17.6 to 21.1). Use of nevirapine or ritonavir alone in the initial regimen (compared with efavirenz) and exposure to prevention of mother to child transmission regimens were independently associated with failure [adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval): 1.77 (1.11 to 2.83), 2.39 (1.57 to 3.64) and 1.40 (1.02 to 1.92), respectively]. Among 252 children with >=1 year follow-up after failure, 38% were switched to second-line. Median (interquartile range) months between failure and switch was 5.7 (2.9-11.0). CONCLUSIONS: Triple ART based on nevirapine or ritonavir as a single protease inhibitor seems to be associated with a higher risk of virologic failure. A low proportion of virologically failing children were switched."
21124844,Frequency of HIV-1 viral load monitoring of patients initially successfully treated with combination antiretroviral therapy.,"BACKGROUND: Although considered an essential tool for monitoring the effect of combination antiretroviral treatment (CART), HIV-1 RNA (viral load, VL) testing is greatly influenced by cost and availability of resources. OBJECTIVES: To examine whether HIV infected patients who were initially successfully treated with CART have less frequent monitoring of VL over time and whether CART failure and other HIV-disease and sociodemographic characteristics are associated with less frequent VL testing. METHODS: The study included patients who started CART in the period 1999-2004, were older than 18 years, CART naive, had two consecutive viral load measurements of <400 copies/ml after 5 months of treatment and had continuous CART during the first 15 months. The time between two consecutive visits (days) was the outcome and associated factors were assessed using linear mixed models. RESULTS: We analyzed a total of 128 patients with 1683 visits through December 2009. CART failure was observed in 31 (24%) patients. When adjusted for the follow-up time, the mean interval between two consecutive VL tests taken in patients before CART failure (155.2 days) was almost identical to the interval taken in patients who did not fail CART (155.3 days). On multivariable analysis, we found that the adjusted estimated time between visits was 150.9 days before 2003 and 177.6 in 2008/2009. A longer time between visits was observed in seafarers compared to non-seafarers; the mean difference was 30.7 days (95% CI, 14.0 to 47.4; p<0.001); and in individuals who lived more than 160 kilometers from the HIV treatment center (mean difference, 16 days, p = 0.010). CONCLUSIONS: Less frequent monitoring of VL became common in recent years and was not associated with failure. We identified seafarers as a population with special needs for CART monitoring and delivery."
21150591,Monitoring of highly active antiretroviral therapy in HIV infection.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in high-income countries have routine laboratory tests to monitor ART efficacy/toxicity. We review studies describing the outcomes and costs of different monitoring approaches, predominantly in low-income countries. RECENT FINDINGS: CD4 cell counts, HIV RNA viral load and clinical events are frequently discordant; viral load suppression occurs with WHO-defined CD4 failure and, as expected, viral load failure often occurs before CD4 failure. Routine CD4 monitoring provides small but significant mortality/morbidity benefits over clinical monitoring, but, at current prices, is not yet cost-effective in many sub-Saharan African countries. Viral load monitoring is less cost-effective with modelling studies reporting variable results. More research into point-of-care tests, methods for targeting monitoring and thresholds for defining failure is needed. Most laboratory monitoring for toxicity is neither effective nor cost-effective. In terms of models for delivery of care, task-shifting with nurse-led and decentralized care appear as effective as doctor-led or centralized care. SUMMARY: Recent studies have improved the evidence base for monitoring on ART. Future research to increase cost-effectiveness by better targeting of monitoring and/or evaluating implementation of less costly point-of-care tests will contribute to long-term success of ART while continuing to increase ART coverage."
21185531,HIV-infected adolescents: relationship between atazanavir plasma levels and bilirubin concentrations.,The use of atazanavir (ATV) in adolescents infected with human immunodeficiency virus was analyzed in this study. ATV morning plasma concentrations were determined during regular visits to the outpatient department. Results showed that bilirubin levels were higher among patients with higher ATV plasma concentrations (p = .018). Monitoring plasma levels of ATV could avoid toxicity in these patients.
21192233,Effect on transmission of HIV-1 resistance of timing of implementation of viral load monitoring to determine switches from first to second-line antiretroviral regimens in resource-limited settings.,"BACKGROUND: There is concern that antiretroviral therapy (ART) use with only clinical monitoring for failure will result in high rates of transmission of virus with resistance to drugs currently in use. METHODS: A stochastic simulation model of transmission of HIV, natural history and the effect of ART, was developed and used to predict the proportion of new infections with resistance according to whether and when viral load monitoring is introduced. RESULTS: In our base model, there was predicted to be 12.4% of new HIV infections with primary antiretroviral resistance in 2020 if clinical monitoring is used throughout, compared with 5.4 and 6.1% if viral load-guided switching (based on viral load measured every 6 months, with switch determined by a value >500 copies/ml) was introduced in 2010 or 2015, respectively. The death rate for those on ART was lowest when viral load monitoring was used, but the overall death rate in all infected people was higher if viral load monitoring was introduced at the expense of scale-up in HIV diagnosis and ART initiation beyond their 2010 coverage levels (4.7 compared with 3.1 per 100 person-years). INTERPRETATION: To preserve current first-line drugs for the long term there is an eventual need for some form of cheap and practical viral load monitoring in resource-limited settings. However, a delay in introduction of 5 years has limited consequences for resistance transmission so the current priority for countries' ART programmes is to increase HIV testing and provide treatment for all those in need of ART."
21192311,Adherence to HIV therapeutic drug monitoring guidelines in The Netherlands.,"BACKGROUND: Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is recommended in several international HIV treatment guidelines. The adherence of clinicians to these recommendations is unknown. The authors evaluated the adherence to the Dutch TDM guideline of 2005. METHODS: From the ATHENA cohort study, three scenarios were selected for which the guideline recommended TDM: 1) start of a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir + efavirenz or nevirapine (drug-drug interaction); 2) start of efavirenz (routine TDM); and 3) use of nelfinavir during pregnancy. For each scenario, we determined the proportion of patients for whom TDM was performed. Multivariable logistic regression modeling was used to identify determinants for the use of TDM. RESULTS: The adherence to the TDM guideline was 46.7% in patients who started lopinavir/ritonavir plus efavirenz or nevirapine; 9.5% for patients who started efavirenz; and 58.5% for patients who used nelfinavir during pregnancy. Patients treated in clinics that had a TDM assay available locally and patients treated in academic clinics were more likely to receive TDM. A higher baseline HIV viral load was another significant predictor for the performing TDM. CONCLUSION: The adherence of clinicians to the Dutch TDM guidelines varied from low to moderate for the three investigated TDM scenarios. This study identifies several determinants for the use of TDM, which may be useful information for those responsible for generating TDM guidelines."
21210843,Atypical pharmacokinetics of atazanavir in an HIV-1-infected patient.,"An HIV-infected patient with very low atazanavir (ATV) plasma trough concentrations despite clinical signs of poor drug tolerability was described. By therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), the authors found that the patient had an atypical ATV pharmacokinetics characterized by rapid drug absorption followed by very fast drug clearance probably attributable to his genetic background. This case underlines the importance of traditional and pharmacogenetic-based TDM for the individualization of ATV therapy in HIV-1 patients."
21233689,Influence of body weight on achieving indinavir concentrations within its therapeutic window in HIV-infected Thai patients receiving indinavir boosted with ritonavir.,"Indinavir boosted with ritonavir (IDV/r) dosing with 400/100 mg, twice daily, is preferred in Thai adults, but this dose can lead to concentrations close to the boundaries of its therapeutic window. The objectives of this analysis were to validate a population pharmacokinetic model to describe IDV/r concentrations in HIV-infected Thai patients and to investigate the impact of patient characteristics on achieving adequate IDV concentrations. IDV/r concentration data from 513 plasma samples were available. Population means and variances of pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated using a nonlinear mixed effects regression model (NONMEM Version VI). Monte Carlo simulations were performed to estimate the probability of achieving IDV concentrations within its therapeutic window. IDV/r pharmacokinetics were best described by a one-compartment model coupled with a single transit compartment absorption model. Body weight influenced indinavir apparent oral clearance and volume of distribution and allometric scaling significantly reduced the interindividual variability. Final population estimates (interindividual variability in percentage) of indinavir apparent oral clearance and volume of distribution were 21.3 L/h/70 kg (30%) and 90.7 L/70 kg (22%), respectively. Based on model simulations, the probability of achieving an IDV trough concentration greater than 0.1 mg/L was greater than 99% for 600/100 mg and greater than 98% for 400/100 mg, twice daily, in patients weighing 40 to 80 kg. However, the probability of achieving IDV concentrations associated with an increased risk of drug toxicity (greater than 10.0 mg/L) increased from 1% to 10% with 600/100 mg compared with less than 1% with 400/100 mg when body weight decreased from 80 to 40 kg. The validated model developed predicts that 400/100 mg of IDV/r, twice daily, provides indinavir concentrations within the recommended therapeutic window for the majority of patients. The risk of toxic drug concentrations increases rapidly with IDV/r dose of 600/100 mg for patients less than 50 kg and therapeutic drug monitoring of IDV concentrations would help to reduce the risk of IDV-induced nephrotoxicity."
21235403,Baseline predictors of ninety percent or higher antiretroviral therapy adherence in a diverse urban sample: the role of patient autonomy and fatalistic religious beliefs.,"The role of patient autonomy and influence of religious/spiritual beliefs on antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence is to date not fully understood. This study assessed baseline predictors of high ART adherence (>=90%) measured by electronic drug monitors (EDM) at 12 and 24 weeks after enrollment in a randomized controlled trial testing behavioral interventions to improve ART adherence. Baseline data were collected with audio computer-assisted self interviews (ACASI) surveys among a diverse urban sample of HIV-infected participants (n = 204) recruited from community clinics in a large midwestern city. Baseline variables included a range of established ART adherence predictors as well as several less frequently studied variables related to patient autonomy and religious/spiritual beliefs. Statistically significant (p < 0.05) variables identified in univariate analyses were included in subsequent multivariate analyses predicting higher than 90% adherence at 12 and 24 weeks. Several baseline predictors retained statistical significance in multivariate analysis at 24 weeks. Baseline levels of autonomous support from friends and family, motivation to adhere, and having an active coping style were all positively associated with adherence, while the belief that God is in control of one's health was negatively associated with adherence. Results indicate that effective interventions should include a focus on promoting patients' autonomous regulation and religious/spiritual beliefs regarding ART adherence."
21271406,An interdisciplinary HIV-adherence program combining motivational interviewing and electronic antiretroviral drug monitoring.,"To ensure successful treatment, HIV patients must maintain a high degree of medication adherence over time. Since August 2004, patients who are (or are at risk of) experiencing problems with their HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) have been referred by their physicians to an interdisciplinary HIV-adherence program. The program consists of a multifactorial intervention along with electronic drug monitoring (MEMS(TM)). The pharmacists organize individualized semi-structured motivational interviews based on cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and social issues. At the end of each session, the patient brings an adherence report to the physician. This enables the physician to use the adherence results to evaluate the treatment plan. The aim of this study was to retrospectively analyze this on-going interdisciplinary HIV-adherence program. All patients who were included between August 2004 and the end of April 2008 were analyzed. One hundred and four patients were included (59% women, median age 39 (31.0, 46.0) years, 42% black ethnicity). Eighty (77%) patients were ART-experienced patients and 59% had a protease inhibitor-based treatment. The retention rate was high (92%) in the program. Patient inclusion in this HIV-adherence program was determined by patient issues for naive patients and by nonadherence or suboptimal clinical outcomes for ART-experienced patients. The median time spent by a subject at the pharmacy was 35 (25.0, 48.0) minutes, half for the medication handling and half for the interview. The adherence results showed a persistence of 87% and an execution of 88%. Proportion of undetectable subjects increased during study. In conclusion, retention and persistence rates were high in this highly selected problematic population."
21283017,Atazanavir pharmacokinetics with and without tenofovir during pregnancy.,"BACKGROUND: Few data are available describing atazanavir exposure during pregnancy, especially when used in combination with tenofovir, whose coadministration with atazanavir results in decreased atazanavir exposure. DESIGN: International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials 1026 s is an ongoing, prospective, nonblinded study of antiretroviral pharmacokinetics in HIV-infected pregnant women that included 2 cohorts receiving atazanavir/ritonavir 300 mg/100 mg once daily, either with or without tenofovir. METHODS: Intensive steady-state 24-hour pharmacokinetic profiles were performed during the third trimester and at 6-12 weeks postpartum. Atazanavir was measured by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (detection limit 0.047 mcg/mL). Pharmacokinetic targets were the estimated 10th percentile atazanavir area under the concentration versus time curve [(AUC): 29.4 mcg   hr   mL-1] in nonpregnant historical controls (mean AUC = 57 mcg   hr   mL-1) and a trough concentration of 0.15 mcg/mL, the concentration target used in therapeutic drug monitoring programs. RESULTS: Median atazanavir AUC was reduced during the third trimester compared with postpartum for subjects not receiving tenofovir (41.9 vs. 57.9 mcg   hr   mL-1, P = 0.02) and for subjects receiving tenofovir (28.8 vs. 39.6 mcg   hr   mL-1, P = 0.04). During the third trimester, AUC was below the target in 33% (6 of 18) of women not receiving tenofovir and 55% (11 of 20) of women receiving tenofovir. Trough concentration was below the target in 6% (1 of 18) of women not receiving tenofovir and 15% (3 of 20) of women receiving tenofovir. The median (range) ratio of cord blood/maternal atazanavir concentration in 29-paired samples was 0.18 (0-0.45). CONCLUSIONS: Atazanavir exposure is reduced by pregnancy and by concomitant tenofovir use. A dose increase of atazanavir/ritonavir to 400 mg/100 mg may be necessary in pregnant women to ensure atazanavir exposure equivalent to that seen in nonpregnant adults."
21288774,"First-line antiretroviral therapy with a protease inhibitor versus non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor and switch at higher versus low viral load in HIV-infected children: an open-label, randomised phase 2/3 trial.","BACKGROUND: Children with HIV will be on antiretroviral therapy (ART) longer than adults, and therefore the durability of first-line ART and timing of switch to second-line are key questions. We assess the long-term outcome of protease inhibitor and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) first-line ART and viral load switch criteria in children. METHODS: In a randomised open-label factorial trial, we compared effectiveness of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) plus a protease inhibitor versus two NRTIs plus an NNRTI and of switch to second-line ART at a viral load of 1000 copies per mL versus 30,000 copies per mL in previously untreated children infected with HIV from Europe and North and South America. Random assignment was by computer-generated sequentially numbered lists stratified by age, region, and by exposure to perinatal ART. Primary outcome was change in viral load between baseline and 4 years. Analysis was by intention to treat, which we defined as all patients that started treatment. This study is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN73318385. FINDINGS: Between Sept 25, 2002, and Sept 7, 2005, 266 children (median age 6.5 years; IQR 2.8-12.9) were randomly assigned treatment regimens: 66 to receive protease inhibitor and switch to second-line at 1000 copies per mL (PI-low), 65 protease inhibitor and switch at 30,000 copies per mL (PI-higher), 68 NNRTI and switch at 1000 copies per mL (NNRTI-low), and 67 NNRTI and switch at 30,000 copies per mL (NNRTI-higher). Median follow-up was 5.0 years (IQR 4.2-6.0) and 188 (71%) children were on first-line ART at trial end. At 4 years, mean reductions in viral load were -3.16 log(10) copies per mL for protease inhibitors versus -3.31 log(10) copies per mL for NNRTIs (difference -0.15 log(10) copies per mL, 95% CI -0.41 to 0.11; p=0.26), and -3.26 log(10) copies per mL for switching at the low versus -3.20 log(10) copies per mL for switching at the higher threshold (difference 0.06 log(10) copies per mL, 95% CI -0.20 to 0.32; p=0.56). Protease inhibitor resistance was uncommon and there was no increase in NRTI resistance in the PI-higher compared with the PI-low group. NNRTI resistance was selected early, and about 10% more children accumulated NRTI mutations in the NNRTI-higher than the NNRTI-low group. Nine children had new CDC stage-C events and 60 had grade 3/4 adverse events; both were balanced across randomised groups. INTERPRETATION: Good long-term outcomes were achieved with all treatments strategies. Delayed switching of protease-inhibitor-based ART might be reasonable where future drug options are limited, because the risk of selecting for NRTI and protease-inhibitor resistance is low.

21288854,Pooling strategies to reduce the cost of HIV-1 RNA load monitoring in a resource-limited setting.,"BACKGROUND: Quantitative human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNA load testing surpasses CD4 cell count and clinical monitoring in detecting antiretroviral therapy (ART) failure; however, its cost can be prohibitive. Recently, the use of pooling strategies with a clinically appropriate viral load threshold was shown to be accurate and efficient for monitoring when the prevalence of virologic failure is low. METHODS: We used laboratory request form information to identify specimens with a low pretest probability of virologic failure. Patients aged >=15 years who were receiving first-line ART had individual viral load results available were eligible. Blood plasma, dried blood spots, and dried plasma spots were evaluated. Two pooling strategies were compared: minipools of 5 samples and a 10 x10 matrix platform (liquid plasma specimens only). A deconvolution algorithm was used to identify specimens(s) with detectable viral loads. RESULTS: The virologic failure rate in the study sample was <10%. Specimens included were liquid plasma specimens tested in minipools(n = 400), of which 300 were available for testing by matrix, and specimens tested with minipools only: dried blood spots (n = 100) and dried plasma spots (n = 185). Pooling methods resulted in 30.5%-60% fewer HIV RNA tests required to screen the study sample. For plasma pooling, the matrix strategy had the better efficiency, but minipools of 5 dried blood spots had the best efficiency overall and were accurate at a >95% negative predictive value with minimal technical requirements. CONCLUSIONS: In resource-constrained settings, a combination of preselection of patients with low pretest probability of virologic failure and pooled testing can reduce the cost of virologic monitoring without compromising accuracy."
21294595,Pharmacokinetic optimization of antiretroviral therapy in children and adolescents.,"There are over 2.1 million HIV-infected children worldwide, who are increasingly exposed to antiretroviral therapy. Given the enormous physiological changes associated with maturation, the role of individualized therapy and optimal dosing in children and adolescents is likely different than in adults. This review summarizes the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenomics of antiretroviral therapy in children and adolescents, and it discusses the roles of these in the optimization of therapy through the practice of therapeutic drug monitoring/management. Within the pharmacodynamics section are tables and discussion about what is known of the relationships between drug concentrations, inhibitory quotients and effects - both desired and toxic. The pharmacokinetics section summarizes all reported antiretroviral pharmacokinetic data in children, divided into data from population and non-population analytic approaches. Measures of interindividual pharmacokinetic variability are reported. Sampling strategies for the measurement and the interpretation of plasma antiretroviral drug concentrations are suggested, as well as dosing with degrees of renal or hepatic failure. Relevant pharmacogenomic polymorphisms are summarized, and the role for pharmacogenomics testing is discussed. Incorporation of dose adjustment on the basis of measured serum drug concentrations is reviewed, including all such paediatric experience reported in the literature. Discussion of the influences of malnutrition and herbal remedies is also included. Finally, consideration is given to future work in this field."

21361862,Impact of the frequency of plasma HIV-1 RNA monitoring on the outcome of antiretroviral therapy.,"BACKGROUND: Current guidelines for HIV management recommend monitoring plasma HIV-1 RNA level every 3-6 months in patients on a stable antiretroviral regimen. However, cost is the major obstacle to follow the guidelines in resource-limited settings. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the outcome of antiretroviral therapy among HIV-infected patients on a stable regimen who had plasma HIV-1 RNA monitoring once vs. twice yearly. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted among HIV-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy since 2002 at Chiang Mai University Hospital, Thailand. We evaluated the incidence of virological failure and number of reverse transcriptase (RT) mutations between groups. RESULTS: Of 551 patients on a stable antiretroviral regimen, 405 (73.5%) and 146 (26.5%) patients had plasma HIV-1 RNA measurement once and twice yearly, respectively. Forty-seven of 405 patients (11.6%) in once-yearly group and 15 of 146 patients (10.3%) in twice-yearly group developed virological failure, giving the incidence rate of 2.03/100 and 1.95/100 person-years, respectively. The probability of virological failure did not differ between groups (p=0.897, log-rank test). The number of RT mutations was not statistically different between groups (all p-values>0.05). The predicting factors for virological failure from a multivariate analysis were adherence rate <95% and baseline CD4 cell count <50 cells/mm3 but not the frequency of HIV-1 RNA monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of virological failure and the number of RT mutations were not different between groups. Therefore, in resource-limited settings, the recommendation to perform plasma HIV-1 RNA measurement once yearly in patients on a stable antiretroviral regimen is justified."
21364060,Utility of therapeutic drug monitoring in the management of HIV-infected pregnant women in receipt of lopinavir.,"The pharmacokinetics of antiretroviral drugs in pregnancy is poorly understood. We reviewed the use of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) in clinical settings to document plasma concentrations of lopinavir during pregnancy and investigated how clinicians acted upon TDM results. A retrospective review was carried out of all HIV-infected pregnant women taking boosted lopinavir-based highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) at five National Health Service (NHS) centres in the UK between May 2004 and March 2007. Seventy-three women in receipt of lopinavir were identified, of whom 89% had plasma lopinavir concentrations above the suggested minimum recommended for wild-type HIV. Initial TDM results prompted dosage change in 10% and assessment of adherence and/or pharmacist review in 11%. TDM was repeated in 29%. TDM can play an important role in the clinical management of HIV-positive pregnant women, allowing informed dose modification and an alternative measure of adherence."
21383652,The International Interlaboratory Quality Control Program for Measurement of Antiretroviral Drugs in Plasma: a global proficiency testing program.,"The International Interlaboratory Quality Control Program for Measurement of Antiretroviral Drugs in Plasma was initiated in 1999 by Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Center, The Netherlands, and continued later on in collaboration with the Dutch Association for Quality Assessment in Therapeutic Drug Monitoring and Clinical Toxicology (www.kkgt.nl). The aim of this analysis was to evaluate the first 10 years of the Program and to determine variables associated with reporting of less accurate results. Two rounds are organized annually in which blind samples are shipped to participants containing a low, medium, or high concentration of each antiretroviral drug. Any reported result that deviates more than 20% from the spiked concentration is defined as inaccurate. By the end of 2009, the number of laboratories participating in the Program had increased to 56; 44 (79%) are located in Europe. A total of 12,798 test results was available for analysis, of which 2104 (16.4%) were reported as inaccurate. Performance was best for samples containing nevirapine (mean of inadequate scores per round: 11.1%) and lopinavir (11.9%) and worst for indinavir (18.7%), atazanavir (18.9%), saquinavir (19.6%), and nelfinavir (21.3%). High and medium concentrations were less frequently reported as inaccurate than low concentrations: 13.5%, 13.0%, and 22.4%, respectively. Although the overall performance of the laboratories varied per year, a trend was visible for improvement over time with 19.9% of the results being inaccurate in 2002 (n = 20 laboratories) to 15.7% in 2009 (n = 56 laboratories). The Program provides a proficiency testing program in which laboratories are alerted to potential analytical errors while performing therapeutic drug monitoring in HIV-infected patients. Laboratories should put more effort in adequately analyzing concentrations of antiretroviral drugs with low minimum effective concentrations."
21393146,The DART trial: 'The doctor's dilemma' revisited.,"Treatment of HIV infection in developing countries, particularly those in Africa, is still a major challenge to healthcare systems with limited laboratory resources. While drug costs have fallen to levels where antiretroviral therapy is now possible in these countries, and results suggest that adherence is as good as in developed countries, questions remain regarding the effect of scarce laboratory resources on treatment monitoring and, hence, outcome. The DART trial aimed to measure the effect of laboratory monitoring. This randomized controlled trial evaluated the differences between routine laboratory monitoring and monitoring driven by clinical events, and was conducted between January 2003 and December 2008 at sites in Uganda and Zimbabwe. The results indicate that clinically driven monitoring is likely to be more cost-effective in this resource-limited situation."
21435743,[Treatment of hepatitis C virus in HIV-positive patients].,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-HIV coinfection currently occurs in more than 30% of HIV-positive patients in Spain. Nowadays, the treatment of choice for chronic hepatitis due to HCV infection in HIV-positive patients is pegylated interferon plus ribavirin. This combination achieves an overall cure rate of 50%, which is somewhat lower than those obtained in patients with HCV monoinfection. Adverse effects are frequent, leading to treatment withdrawal in 10-20% of patients. Importantly, there are three new features of hepatitis C in patients with HIV: (1) the recent development of epidemic outbreaks of acute hepatitis due to HCV infection in HIV-positive men caused by homosexual activity, (2) pharmacogenetic markers in the form of genetic polymorphisms near the IL28B gene related to response to HCV treatment as well as spontaneous eradication of HCV after acute infection, and (3) new antiviral molecules have allowed triple combination treatments to be designed and the preliminary results of clinical trials reporting high response rates are highly promising."
21447868,Successful efavirenz dose reduction guided by therapeutic drug monitoring.,"BACKGROUND: There are potential benefits to individualizing dosage in patients treated with efavirenz (EFV). We tested a simplified algorithm based on a Bayesian pharmacokinetic approach for guiding dose reduction in patients with EFV concentrations above the 75th percentile (P75) with documented virological efficacy. METHODS: We designed a prospective, open-label, multicentre study. All consenting participants with EFV concentrations above P75 on standard dosage were included in a dose-reduction cycle. Primary end point was the number of patients who reached plasma concentrations within target (1,000-4,000 ng/ml) after, at most, two cycles of dose reduction at 3 and 6 months. CYP2B6 genetic characterization was performed. RESULTS: Seventy-two patients were screened and 13 fulfilled selection criteria. These patients, with undetectable viraemia on a stable 600 mg EFV-based regimen, had a median (interquartile range) EFV plasma level of 8,112 ng/ml (5,993-10,278) at baseline; 38% (between P75 and P95) qualified for a 400 mg EFV dose, and 62% (above P95) qualified for a 200 mg EFV dose. After one to two dose-reduction cycles, all patients reached targets for EFV plasma concentration at 24 weeks. The predictive dose reduction based on genetic profile differed from dose reduction according to therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) in three patients. All patients maintained viral suppression at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: A standardized TDM-guided EFV dose-reduction strategy over a 24-week period was successful, safe and yielded EFV plasma concentrations within the recommended therapeutic range. In addition to improving neuropsychiatric tolerability, EFV dose reduction has the potential to substantially decrease treatment cost."
21507924,Atazanavir concentration in hair is the strongest predictor of outcomes on antiretroviral therapy.,"BACKGROUND: Adequate exposure to antiretrovirals is important to maintain durable responses, but methods to assess exposure (eg, querying adherence and single plasma drug level measurements) are limited. Hair concentrations of antiretrovirals can integrate adherence and pharmacokinetics into a single assay. METHODS: Small hair samples were collected from participants in the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS), a large cohort of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected (and at-risk noninfected) women. From 2003 through 2008, we analyzed atazanavir hair concentrations longitudinally for women reporting receipt of atazanavir-based therapy. Multivariate random effects logistic regression models for repeated measures were used to estimate the association of hair drug levels with the primary outcome of virologic suppression (HIV RNA level, <80 copies/mL). RESULTS: 424 WIHS participants (51% African-American, 31% Hispanic) contributed 1443 person-visits to the analysis. After adjusting for age, race, treatment experience, pretreatment viral load, CD4 count and AIDS status, and self-reported adherence, hair levels were the strongest predictor of suppression. Categorized hair antiretroviral levels revealed a monotonic relationship to suppression; women with atazanavir levels in the highest quintile had odds ratios (ORs) of 59.8 (95% confidence ratio, 29.0-123.2) for virologic suppression. Hair atazanavir concentrations were even more strongly associated with resuppression of viral loads in subgroups in which there had been previous lapses in adherence (OR, 210.2 [95% CI, 46.0-961.1]), low hair levels (OR, 132.8 [95% CI, 26.5-666.0]), or detectable viremia (OR, 400.7 [95% CI, 52.3-3069.7]). CONCLUSIONS: Antiretroviral hair levels surpassed any other predictor of virologic outcomes to HIV treatment in a large cohort. Low antiretroviral exposure in hair may trigger interventions prior to failure or herald virologic failure in settings where measurement of viral loads is unavailable. Monitoring hair antiretroviral concentrations may be useful for prolonging regimen durability."
21525020,Cellular HIV-1 DNA quantification and short-term and long-term response to antiretroviral therapy.,"BACKGROUND: The aim of our study was to determine whether HIV-1 DNA level before antiretroviral therapy (ART) was associated with short- and long-term virological and immunological responses. METHODS: Patients starting first-line protease inhibitor-containing regimens were enrolled in a prospective multicentre cohort in 1998-99. HIV-1 DNA was quantified using real-time PCR at baseline and after 1 year of ART. The association between HIV-1 DNA and virological and immunological responses after 1 and 7 years on ART was studied in multivariate regression models along with other biological and clinical variables. Virological failure (VF) at month 12 (M12) was defined as a plasma HIV-1 RNA >500 copies/mL. Time to death or two plasma HIV-1 RNA >500 copies/mL between M12 and M84 was studied for long-term VF. RESULTS: HIV-1 DNA levels were measured in 148 patients. The median baseline peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) HIV-1 DNA was 3.7 log(10) copies/10(6) PBMCs. At M12, the median PBMC HIV-1 DNA was 2.99 log(10) copies/10(6) PBMCs. The median decrease in PBMC HIV-1 DNA between M0 and M12 was -0.7 log(10) copies/10(6) PBMCs. Higher baseline PBMC HIV-1 DNA and plasma HIV-1 RNA were independently associated with a higher risk of VF at M12. Only the baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was independently associated with long-term virological response. The baseline CD4 cell count was the only parameter associated with short- and long-term immunological responses. CONCLUSIONS: HIV-1 DNA impacted the virological response in our cohort. Further research is warranted to study the impact of HIV-1 DNA with currently recommended first-line cART."
21534886,Antiretroviral use during pregnancy for treatment or prophylaxis.,"INTRODUCTION: Antiretrovirals are recommended for all pregnant women either for treatment of HIV-1 infection or for prevention of mother-to-child transmission. Distinguishing between HIV-1-infected pregnant women who meet treatment criteria and those who do not (who use antiretrovirals during pregnancy for prophylaxis) is accomplished by assessing the HIV-1 disease stage and has important implications regarding when antiretroviral drugs are initiated during pregnancy, what drugs are used and antiretroviral use after delivery. AREAS COVERED: This review addresses antiretroviral use by HIV-1-infected women during pregnancy. Specifically, the review focuses on antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1-infected pregnant women who meet criteria for treatment and antiretroviral prophylaxis for HIV-1-infected pregnant women (to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1). The review primarily addresses antiretroviral use in resource-rich settings, but use in resource-poor settings is briefly addressed. EXPERT OPINION: Antiretrovirals represent only one component of the overall management of HIV-1 infected pregnant women and, therefore, cannot be viewed in isolation from other components of optimal care for HIV-1-infected women and from other efficacious interventions to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1. Antiretrovirals can be used safely and effectively during pregnancy. We concur with current guidelines regarding the threshold that differentiates which women need antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 infection for their own health versus those who need prophylaxis to prevent transmission of HIV-1 infection to their child. We thus recommend that lifelong antiretroviral therapy be initiated in patients with an AIDS-defining illness, a CD4 count < 350 cells/mm(3) or other co-morbid conditions such as acute opportunistic infections, HIV-1-associated nephropathy or hepatitis B co-infection. Irrespective of whether or not antiretrovirals are used during pregnancy, or whether antiretrovirals during pregnancy are used for treatment or prophylaxis, all infants of HIV-1-infected women should receive antiretroviral post-exposure prophylaxis."
21544014,Therapeutic drug monitoring of protease inhibitors and efavirenz in HIV-infected individuals with active substance-related disorders.,"BACKGROUND: Achieving targeted antiretroviral (ARV) plasma concentrations during long-term treatment in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with substance-related disorders (SRDs) may be challenging due to a number of factors, including medication adherence, coinfection with hepatitis B or C virus, medication intolerance, and drug interactions. One approach to investigate these factors is to conduct therapeutic drug monitoring to measure ARV exposure during treatment. The objective of this study was to utilize therapeutic drug monitoring to compare efavirenz (EFV) and protease inhibitor pharmacokinetics in patients with and without SRDs. METHODS: This was a multicenter, cross-sectional open-label study in patients with HIV-1 infection receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART), with active (n=129) or without (n=146) SRD according to National Institute on Drug Abuse criteria. Two hundred seventy-five subjects who were receiving either protease inhibitor-based or EFV-based ART regimens for >6 months were enrolled at 4 HIV treatment centers with an equal distribution of SRD and non-SRD at each site. The patients were instructed during enrollment visits with regard to the importance of adherence before and after study visits. Demographics and routine clinical laboratory tests were recorded. RESULTS: Among the 275 patients, 47% had SRD with at least 1 substance. There were no significant differences between SRD and non-SRD groups for race, gender, age, or CD4 count at entry. A significantly higher proportion of patients with SRD had an entry HIV RNA plasma concentration>75 copies per milliliter compared with patients without SRD (40% vs 28%, P=0.044). Logistic regression modeling revealed an association between HIV RNA plasma concentration and African American race (P=0.017). A significantly higher proportion of SRDs also had an EFV or protease inhibitor trough concentration below the desired range (23% vs 9%, P=0.048). Significantly lower trough concentrations were noted in patients with SRDs receiving atazanavir (0.290 vs 0.976 mug/mL) or lopinavir (3.75 vs 5.30 mug/mL). CONCLUSIONS: The pharmacokinetic data indicate differences between HIV-infected patients with and without SRDs that may influence viral load suppression during long-term ART. These findings require additional investigation in a randomized design with more intensive pharmacokinetic assessment to identify individual factors that are contributing to suboptimal ARV exposure in patients with SRDs."
21544015,"Therapeutic monitoring and variability of atazanavir in HIV-infected patients, with and without HCV coinfection, receiving boosted or unboosted regimens.","BACKGROUND: Adequate plasma trough concentrations (Ctrough) of protease inhibitors are required to maintain antiviral activity throughout the dosing interval. Therapeutic drug monitoring is used in clinical practice to optimize dosage and avoid toxic or subtherapeutic drug exposure. The pharmacokinetic variability of Atazanavir (ATV) can be relatively large, as a result of several factors. One of the affecting factors may be hepatic impairment due to hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection. METHODS: We collected trough plasma samples from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1-infected outpatients, with and without HCV coinfection and/or cirrhosis, receiving stable highly active antiretroviral therapy containing ATV. In the total population, we mainly compared the 2 regimens: 300ATV + 100RTV OD [ritonavir (RTV), once daily (OD)] versus 400ATV OD. We used a threshold value of 0.15 mug/mL, based on the proposed therapeutic range (0.15-0.85 mug/mL). Plasma concentrations of ATV were determined by a validated assay using high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection. A total of 214 HIV-infected outpatients were included. For each regimen, we compared 3 groups of subjects: HIV+/HCV-, HIV+/HCV+, and HIV+/HCV+ with cirrhosis. RESULTS: In the whole study population, we observed a large variability and found suboptimal Ctrough levels (<0.15 mug/mL) in 23 subjects (2 belonging to the 300/100 OD group and 21 to the 400 OD group). For the standard dosage regimen of 300ATV + 100RTV OD, we did not find a statistical difference between HIV-infected patients without HCV coinfection versus HIV-infected patients with HCV coinfection: median 0.85 (interquartile range 0.53-1.34) and 0.95 (0.70-1.36) mug/mL, respectively. In HIV+/HCV+-infected patients with cirrhosis, we found a median Ctrough of 0.70 (0.43-1.0) mug/mL, with no statistical difference when compared with HIV+/HCV- infected patients. For the 400ATV OD (n=90) dosage regimen, the total median ATV Ctrough was 0.40 (0.23-1.0) mug/mL. In this group, we found a statistically significant difference between HIV+/HCV- and HIV+/HCV+-infected patients: median Ctrough was 0.23 (0.11-0.42) and 0.52 (0.20-1.0) mug/mL, respectively. In HIV+/HCV+ subjects with cirrhosis, the Ctrough median value was 0.42 (0.13-0.75) mug/mL, and there was a significant difference when compared with HIV patients without coinfection. CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic drug monitoring of ATV in patients receiving unboosted regimen may be useful to identify those HIV-infected subjects, with or without HCV coinfection, who may benefit from adding low RTV doses, or the subset of patients in whom removal of RTV could be attempted without the risk of suboptimal plasma ATV exposure."
21555806,Serum Nevirapine and Efavirenz concentrations and effect of concomitant rifampicin in HIV infected children on antiretroviral therapy.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine factors affecting serum levels of Efavirenz and Nevirapine and analyze the effect of Rifampicin on Nevirapine drug levels. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 30 HIV infected children on Antiretroviral therapy (ART) with Nevirapine or Efavirenz. Patients on simultaneous Rifampicin and Nevirapine were given higher doses of Nevirapine with regular monitoring of liver function tests. Trough levels (before morning dose of Nevirapine) and levels after 2 hours of administration of Nevirapine and levels of Efavirenz were assessed using HPLC and were checked to see if they fall within the therapeutic range. RESULTS: Thirty patients (14 males) were enrolled in the study with 20 on Nevirapine and 10 (33.3%) on Efavirenz. Seven (23.3%) patients were simultaneously taking rifampicin. The mean Nevirapine dose given to the patients was 350.9+-59.8 mg/m2/day (on simultaneous rifampicin) and 309.2+-54.6 mg/m2/day (not on concurrent rifampicin). Thirteen (81.3%) of the 16 patients with trough Nevirapine had values in the normal range, 1 (6.3%) had low Nevirapine trough levels and 2 (12.5%) had high Nevirapine trough levels. Of the post 2 hours Nevirapine levels, 1 (5%) had low levels and 3 (15%) had high Nevirapine blood levels. Factors like age (P=0.4, P=0.4087), nourishment (P=0.2679, P=0.4132), ART combination (P=0.4199, P=0.4132), form of the drug (tablet/syrup) (P=0.1964, P=0.4696) or if it was being given as single or in a fixed dose combination (P=0.4179, P=0.4696) and even concurrent rifampicin administration (P=0.284, P=0.472) did not significantly affect the trough and post 2 hours Nevirapine values, respectively. All the five patients being given concurrent rifampicin had normal trough and post 2 hours levels of Nevirapine. The Efavirenz drug levels were 1.9+-1.1 g/mL. Of the 10 patients on Efavirenz, 2 (20%) had high and 1 (10%) had low blood levels. CONCLUSION: Concurrent Rifampicin administration does not alter blood levels of Nevirapine; provided the dose of Nevirapine is increased by 20-30%. Formulation of drugs does not alter the blood levels provided drug administered is in the recommended dose."

21566505,The role of therapeutic drug monitoring in the management of patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection.,"Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is a well-established method to optimize dosing regimens in individual patients for drugs that are characterized by a narrow therapeutic range and large interindividual pharmacokinetic variability. For some antiretroviral drugs, mainly nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors, TDM has been proposed as a means to improve the response in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients. In contrast, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors do not show a predictable plasma concentration-response (toxicity, efficacy) relationship, and intracellular analyses are expensive. Therefore, TDM is generally not recommended for this class of drugs. TDM has been successfully applied in the clinical practice for certain antiretroviral drugs, but there are ongoing research efforts on the use and refinement of TDM for human immunodeficiency virus treatment, and convincing data from randomized trials are still needed. The best pharmacokinetic measures of drug exposure such as trough and peak concentrations or concentration ratios have not been unambiguously established."
21649692,Population pharmacokinetics of atazanavir/ritonavir in HIV-1-infected children and adolescents.,"AIMS: To investigate atazanavir (ATV) population pharmacokinetics in children and adolescents, establish factors that influence ATV pharmacokinetics and investigate the ATV exposure after recommended doses. METHODS: Atazanavir concentrations were measured in 51 children/adolescents during a mean therapeutic monitoring follow up of 6.6 months. A total of 151 ATV plasma concentrations were obtained, and a population pharmacokinetic model was developed with NONMEM. Patients received ATV alone or boosted with ritonavir. RESULTS: Atazanavir pharmacokinetics was best described by a one-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination. The effect of bodyweight was added on both apparent elimination clearance (CL/F) and volume of distribution using allometric scaling. Atazanavir CL/F was reduced by ritonavir by 45%. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) co-medication (300 mg) increased significantly by 25% the atazanavir/ritonavir (ATV/r) CL/F. Mean ATV/r CL/F values with or without TDF were 8.9 and 7.1 L h(-1) (70 kg)(-1), respectively. With the recommended 250/100 mg and 300/100 mg ATV/r doses, the exposure was higher than the mean adult steady-state exposure in the bodyweight range of 32-50 kg. CONCLUSIONS: To target the mean adult exposure, children should receive the following once-daily ATV/r dose: 200/100 mg from 25 to 39 kg, 250/100 mg from 39 to 50 kg and 300/100 mg above 50 kg. When 300 mg TDF is co-administered, children should receive (ATV/r) at 250/100 mg between 35 and 39 kg, then 300/100 mg over 39 kg."
21671545,Common adverse effects of antiretroviral therapy for HIV disease.,"Family physicians are treating patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus in their practices more often. Long-term complications of this disease are multifactorial and can be related to the virus itself or to adverse effects of antiretroviral therapy. Each drug class has side effects: nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors are associated with lactic acidosis, lipodystrophy, and hyperlipidemia; non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors are associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms, rash, liver toxicity, and lipid abnormalities; and protease inhibitors are associated with gastrointestinal intolerance and glucose and lipid abnormalities. The entry inhibitor maraviroc and the integrase inhibitor raltegravir have been approved for treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients. Maraviroc is associated with bronchitis, nasopharyngitis, and esophageal candidiasis. Adverse effects of raltegravir are comparable to those experienced with placebo, with the exception of increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Information about drug interactions for both of these medications is limited. Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors are primarily metabolized through the cytochrome P450 system, and as a result have numerous drug-drug interactions. Monitoring for adverse effects of antiretroviral therapy includes a complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic profile every three to six months. A lipid profile and urinalysis for proteinuria should be per- formed annually. Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry should be considered in patients older than 50 years. Long-term morbidity related to antiretroviral therapy includes liver, renal, glucose, and lipid abnormalities, and cardiovascular and bone disease. With some exceptions for lipid management, these morbidities can be managed as in the general population."

We investigated the feasibility of using saliva for compliance monitoring of zidovudine (ZDV), lamivudine (3TC) and nevirapine (NVP) in 29 HIV-1 infected patients from Rwanda. ZDV, 3TC and NVP drug levels were quantified by an LC/MS-MS method in plasma and stimulated saliva samples and compared using Bland-Altman analysis. Seven patients demonstrated undetectable saliva ZDV levels while five out of these seven also showed no 3TC salivary concentrations. For the other samples, we observed a good agreement between salivary and plasma concentrations of each antiretroviral drug. A significant relation between the difference in saliva and plasma ZDV concentrations and the average ZDV concentration in the two matrices was deduced as follow: y = -380.15 + 1.79 x. The log saliva and plasma concentration difference of both 3TC and NVP was consistent across the range of average log concentration. Overall, we showed large agreement limits suggesting a wide inter patient variability that may result to non-reliable plasma level predictions from saliva drug measurements. Therefore, our results indicate that saliva may serve as a valuable tool only for NVP compliance testing because of its high salivary concentration."
21712217,Within-patient atazanavir trough concentration monitoring in HIV-1-infected patients.,"OBJECTIVE: Protease inhibitors (PIs) exhibit considerable interpatient pharmacokinetic variability in plasma trough concentrations. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is occasionally used to guide chronic dosing to achieve target trough concentrations, but its clinical success assumes minimal intrasubject variability. Therefore, our primary objective was to evaluate intrapatient variability in atazanavir (ATV) plasma trough concentrations in HIV-1-infected patients. DESIGN/METHODS: In a single-site, prospective, cohort study, patients on atazanavir with or without ritonavir (ATV/r or ATV) for 2 clinic visits were enrolled. Adherence and time since last dose (TSLD) were verified at each visit. ATV was assayed with high-performance liquid chromatography. Intra- and interpatient variation was evaluated using the median intraindividual percentage coefficient of variation (ICV). RESULTS: The mean 24-hour ATV trough concentrations for the first and second visit for the ATV/r group (n = 10) was 598 (CV 84%) and 525 ng/mL (CV 66%), respectively (P = .511), and 300 (CV 81%) and 434 ng/mL (CV 106%) for the ATV group (n = 4), respectively (P = .369). Median ICV was 43.1% for all patients (range: 0.6%-107.6%), 38.1% (0.6%-107.6%) for the ATV/r group, and 33.1% (2.3%-87.6%) for the ATV group. CONCLUSIONS: Potential intrapatient variability in ATV troughs suggests that repeated measurements may be required to ensure that target values are maintained."

We compared the Abbott m2000 Real-Time (Abbott) HIV-1 assay with the Roche AMPLICOR Monitor v1.5 (Roche) HIV-1 assay over a range of VL concentrations. Three hundred and eleven plasma samples were tested, including 164 samples from patients on ART >= six months and 147 from ART-naive patients. The Roche assay detected >=400 copies/mL in 158 (50.8%) samples. Of these, Abbott produced 145 (91.8%) detectable results >=400 copies/mL; 13 (8.2%) samples produced discrepant results. Concordance between the assays for detecting HIV-1 RNA >=400 copies/mL was 95.8% (298/311). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of Abbott to detect HIV-1 RNA >=400 copies/mL were 91.8%, 100%, 100% and 92.2%, respectively. For the 151 samples with HIV-1 RNA >=400 copies/mL for both assays, a good linear correlation was found (r = 0.81, P < 0.0001; mean difference, 0.05). The limits of agreement were -0.97 and 1.07 log(10) copies/mL (mean +- 2 SD). The Abbott assay performed well in our setting, offering an alternative methodology for HIV-1 VL for laboratories with realtime polymerase chain reaction (PCR) capacity."
21735508,"Pharmacovigilance for antiretroviral drugs in Africa: lessons from a study in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire.","BACKGROUND: Although antiretroviral treatment (ART)-related adverse drug reactions (ADR) are documented in industrialised countries, there is no pre-existing surveillance system dedicated to ADR monitoring in most African countries. We assessed knowledge towards pharmacovigilance among ART prescribers and available capacity of HIV clinics to conduct ADR monitoring in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire. METHODS: A questionnaire was administered to ART prescribers to assess their knowledge towards the occurrence of ADRs. A retrospective ADR survey was also conducted based on a data query of treatment modification/interruptions in three HIV clinics. Clinical monitors went back to medical charts to review and validate the reasons of the treatment modification/interruptions. RESULTS: Of the 81 ART prescribers interviewed, 25 (31%) declared not grading ADRs and 12 (14.8%) declared notifying ADRs to the national regulatory authorities. Among 5252 adult ART-treated patients who attended the participating clinics in 2008, 599 treatment modifications were identified. Reasons for treatment modification/interruptions identified in the electronic database were documented in the medical charts in 554 cases (92.5%), ADR accounting for 273 cases (45.5%). Toxicity related to ART was graded in only 58 cases (21%) in the medical charts. DISCUSSION: This study describes challenges limiting the implementation of reliable pharmacovigilance activities in HIV clinics in Cote d'Ivoire. The lack of knowledge of ART prescribers concerning ADR grading does not support the spontaneous reporting of ADRs. Using treatment modification/interruptions for ADR monitoring appears feasible, but improvements are needed to respond to key questions related to drug toxicities in the context of ART scale-up in Africa."
21801434,Alternative antiretroviral monitoring strategies for HIV-infected patients in east Africa: opportunities to save more lives?,"BACKGROUND: Updated World Health Organization guidelines have amplified debate about how resource constraints should impact monitoring strategies for HIV-infected persons on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). We estimated the incremental benefit and cost effectiveness of alternative monitoring strategies for east Africans with known HIV infection. METHODS: Using a validated HIV computer simulation based on resource-limited data (USAID and AMPATH) and circumstances (east Africa), we compared alternative monitoring strategies for HIV-infected persons newly started on cART. We evaluated clinical, immunologic and virologic monitoring strategies, including combinations and conditional logic (e.g., only perform virologic testing if immunologic testing is positive). We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) in units of cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), using a societal perspective and a lifetime horizon. Costs were measured in 2008 US dollars, and costs and benefits were discounted at 3%. We compared the ICER of monitoring strategies with those of other resource-constrained decisions, in particular earlier cART initiation (at CD4 counts of 350 cells/mm3 rather than 200 cells/mm3). RESULTS: Monitoring strategies employing routine CD4 testing without virologic testing never maximized health benefits, regardless of budget or societal willingness to pay for additional health benefits. Monitoring strategies employing virologic testing conditional upon particular CD4 results delivered the most benefit at willingness-to-pay levels similar to the cost of earlier cART initiation (approximately $2600/QALY). Monitoring strategies employing routine virologic testing alone only maximized health benefits at willingness-to-pay levels (> $4400/QALY) that greatly exceeded the ICER of earlier cART initiation. CONCLUSIONS: CD4 testing alone never maximized health benefits regardless of resource limitations. Programmes routinely performing virologic testing but deferring cART initiation may increase health benefits by reallocating monitoring resources towards earlier cART initiation."
21809598,"[Infections with human immunodeficiency viruses. Part II: Antiretroviral drugs, therapeutic options, and diagnostics].","Infections with the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV- 1) lead to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), resulting in the establishment of a wide range of severe opportunistic infections. Since the introduction of the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) into the treatment of HIV infections, in many cases a delayed appearance of AIDS-defining diseases is achievable. Life expectancy of antiretrovirally treated HIV-infected people applying HAART could be considerably extended and now resembles that of several other chronic diseases. For the initial treatment of HIV-1 infection, an adjunction with three antiretroviral agents is generally used. In most cases, the application of two nucleoside or nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) together with a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), a protease inhibitor (PI) or an integrase inhibitor (II) is recommended. Before and during antiretroviral treatment, antiretroviral drug resistances, individual tolerance profiles and the needs of the individual patient, as well as several interactions with other drugs have to be considered. Diagnostics of HIV infection is based upon the proof of specific antibodies."
21817186,The lopinavir/ritonavir-associated rise in lipids is not related to lopinavir or ritonavir plasma concentration.,"BACKGROUND: The relationship between lopinavir plasma concentration and the magnitude of lipid elevation after initiation of lopinavir/ritonavir-containing antiretroviral therapy is unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between drug concentration and lipid changes in two patient cohorts. METHODS: First, we analysed, in an outpatient cohort, the correlation between percentage lipid changes and lopinavir concentration, measured at least 2 weeks or more after initiation of lopinavir/ritonavir. Second, we analysed the correlation between lipid changes and lopinavir and ritonavir plasma concentrations in antiretroviral-naive patients enrolled in a trial comparing nevirapine plus lopinavir/ritonavir (533/133 mg twice daily) with zidovudine/lamivudine plus lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily). RESULTS: In 82 outpatients with 215 lopinavir plasma measurements, we found no significant correlations between lopinavir concentration and changes in lipids a median of 522 days after lopinavir/ritonavir initiation in univariable regression analyses, nor in multivariable analyses adjusting for potential confounders. In 40 trial samples collected 24 months after treatment initiation, the mean (95% CI) percentage increase in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc) was significantly greater in the nevirapine/lopinavir/ritonavir group (29.4% [16.8-43.3]) than in the zidovudine/lamivudine/lopinavir/ritonavir group (6.8% [-7.3-23.1]; P=0.03). However, the percentage LDLc change did not correlate with lopinavir or ritonavir concentration ratios (r=-0.25; P=0.17 and r=-0.06; P=0.75). Adding lopinavir or ritonavir concentrations into the multivariable regression analyses did not change the relation between LDLc change and randomized treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Neither in an HIV outpatient clinic cohort nor in a trial comparing two lopinavir/ritonavir-containing therapies did we find any relation between changes in lipids, and lopinavir and ritonavir concentration, after initiating lopinavir/ritonavir-containing treatment."

The probability of virologic failure was significantly associated with a C(trough) < 3 000 ng/mL. Concerning the exposure-toxicity relationship, the emergence of hepatotoxicity was more frequently associated with high C(trough), especially in case of HCV coinfection.

The literature has been analyzed to evaluate the level of evidence of the interest of a therapeutic drug monitoring for efavirenz. Several studies have reported that an efavirenz plasma concentration >1 000 ng/mL is a predictive factor of the viral response. Efavirenz plasma concentrations >4 000 ng/mL were associated to an increase frequency of CNS side effects. CNS toxicity was also more frequent in patients carrying the 516G > T mutation (CYP2B6*6 allele), associated with a significantly greater efavirenz plasma exposure.

Although African Americans are at a higher risk of developing chronic kidney disease, there are limited data examining the influence of race on tenofovir-related nephrotoxicity. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients at a university-affiliated HIV clinic who were prescribed tenofovir between July 1, 2001, and January 31, 2009. The primary outcome was mean change in creatinine clearance. Secondary endpoints assessed the odds of tenofovir discontinuation secondary to nephrotoxicity, and prevalence of grade 2 to 4 serum creatinine elevation and hypophosphatemia during treatment. MAIN FINDINGS: A total of 65 African American and 186 Caucasian patients were included. There were no statistically significant differences in mean change in creatinine clearance, as estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault (-14.2 mL/min vs -15.9 mL/min [P = .525]) and modification of diet in renal disease formulas (-17.2 mL/min/1.73 m2 vs -15.6 mL/min/1.73 m2 [P = .585]) between African Americans and Caucasians. Rates of tenofovir discontinuation secondary to nephrotoxicity were 6.2% and 1.6%, respectively (P = .076). Elevated baseline serum creatinine and female gender may be potential predictors for tenofovir discontinuation. CONCLUSION: There were no statistically significant differences in tenofovir-related renal function changes by race as observed in our HIV patient population."

Using a Zorbax SB-Phenyl reverse-phase analytical column with UV detection, good separation and detection of the drugs was attained within a 10min run time. Intra- and inter-assay precision RSD values were found to be less than 15% at the concentrations examined (0.1-20mug/mL). The LOQ was found to be 0.1mug/mL for each agent and the assay was found to generate a linear response up to 20mug/mL. This low cost assay can accurately detect efavirenz and rifampicin concentrations within a clinically relevant concentration range using standard chromatography equipment, making it particularly applicable to resource-limited settings."
21866336,Relationship between antiretroviral plasma concentration and emergence of HIV-1 resistance mutations at treatment failure.,"PURPOSE: The relationship between antiretroviral pharmacokinetic exposure and acquisition of human immunodeficency virus-1 (HIV-1) drug resistance mutations (DRM) is not fully understood. The aim of this study was to investigate whether antiretroviral plasma concentration could predict the emergence of DRM at treatment failure. METHODS: The study cohort comprised retrospectively selected patients with failing antiretroviral regimens for whom a protease inhibitor (PI) or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) trough concentration measurement (TDM) had been obtained before failure, a genotypic resistance test (GRT1) had been performed before the TDM, and a genotypic resistance test (GRT2) had been performed at therapeutic failure. Drug levels were classified as undetectable/detectable or subtherapeutic/therapeutic according to limits of quantification of a high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet assay or pre-defined efficacy thresholds, respectively. The number of DRM acquired at treatment failure was evaluated by comparing the results of the GRT2 and GRT1. RESULTS: A total of ten and 57 failure episodes occurred among our patients on NNRTI-based and PI-based regimens, respectively, and included in the evaluation. PI concentration was subtherapeutic in 28.1% of patients, among which the levels were undetectable in 21.1%. Twenty-five (43.9%) patients acquired at least one new PI-DRM according to the GRT2. Patients with undetectable PI levels showed a lower emergence of PI-DRM (minor + major) than those with detectable levels (8.3 vs. 53.3%, p = 0.007). Multivariate analysis confirmed that undetectable PI levels were independent negative predictors of DRM selection. NNRTI measurements were subtherapeutic in 2/10 (20%) patients. NNRTI-DRM were acquired by all patients regardless of NNRTI levels. CONCLUSIONS: A PI measurement showing undetectable drug levels prior to treatment failure predicted the lack of emergence of PI-DRM at failure. These results suggest that PI levels can help clinicians interpret the reasons for treatment failure and guide the type of interventions needed."
21886779,HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) in antiretroviral therapy-naive patients in Tanzania not eligible for WHO threshold HIVDR survey is dramatically high.,"BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended guidelines for a HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) survey for resource-limited countries. Eligibility criteria for patients include age below 25 years in order to focus on the prevalence of transmitted HIVDR (tHIVDR) in newly-infected individuals. Most of the participating sites across Africa have so far reported tHIVDR prevalences of below 5%. In this study we investigated whether the rate of HIVDR in patients <25 years is representative for HIVDR in the rest of the therapy-naive population. METHODS AND FINDINGS: HIVDR was determined in 88 sequentially enrolled ART-naive patients from Mwanza, Tanzania (mean age 35.4 years). Twenty patients were aged <25 years and 68 patients were aged 25-63 years. The frequency of HIVDR in the study population was 14.8% (95%; CI 0.072-0.223) and independent of NVP-resistance induced by prevention of mother-to-child transmission programs. Patients >25 years had a significantly higher HIVDR frequency than younger patients (19.1%; 95% CI 0.095-0.28) versus 0%, P = 0.0344). In 2 out of the 16 patients with HIVDR we found traces of antiretrovirals (ARVs) in plasma. CONCLUSIONS: ART-naive patients aged over 25 years exhibited significantly higher HIVDR than younger patients. Detection of traces of ARVs in individuals with HIVDR suggests that besides transmission, undisclosed misuse of ARVs may constitute a significant factor in the generation of the observed high HIVDR rate. The current WHO tHIVDR survey that is solely focused on the transmission of HIVDR and that excludes patients over 25 years of age may therefore result in substantial underestimation of the prevalence of HIVDR in the therapy-naive population. Similar studies should be performed also in other areas to test whether the so far reported optimistic picture of low HIVDR prevalence in young individuals is really representative for the rest of the ART-naive HIV-infected population."
21890538,Plasma concentrations of efavirenz are associated with body weight in HIV-positive individuals.,"BACKGROUND: Efavirenz is among the most widely used antiretroviral drugs. Increased efavirenz exposure has been associated with CNS side effects and also with the chance of emergence of resistance upon treatment interruptions. The objective of this study was to evaluate factors associated with efavirenz plasma concentrations in a cohort of HIV-infected individuals. METHODS: From July 2009 to March 2010, HIV-infected patients with efavirenz as part of antiretroviral therapy (600 mg at night), undetectable viral load for at least 1 year and CD4 cell count >200 cells/mm(3) were consecutively enrolled at the HIV/AIDS ambulatory care unit in southern Brazil. Plasma samples were taken 18-23 h after efavirenz last dose and analysed by validated ultra-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Forty-one subjects were included (21 females). Mean age and weight were 45.4 years and 70.9 kg, respectively. Mean efavirenz plasma concentration was 2.20 +- 2.17 mg/L. Most plasma concentrations (73%) were within the therapeutic window (1-4 mg/L); 17% were below and 10% above the limits. There were no significant associations between efavirenz concentration and age, CD4 cell count, time on antiretroviral treatment and gender. There was significant and inverse correlation between efavirenz concentrations and body weight (P = 0.013) and body mass index (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of well-controlled HIV-positive individuals, patients with lower weight or body mass index had a higher chance of presenting elevated plasma concentrations of efavirenz. Therapeutic drug monitoring to adjust dose might be a helpful tool to decrease efavirenz dose in order to minimize costs and adverse effects."
21912331,Population pharmacokinetics of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra) in HIV-infected patients.,"BACKGROUND: A relationship between plasma concentrations and viral suppression in patients receiving lopinavir (LPV)/ritonavir (RTV) has been observed. Therefore, it is important to increase our knowledge about factors that determine interpatient variability in LPV pharmacokinetics (PK). METHODS: The study, designed to develop and validate population PK models for LPV and RTV, involved 263 ambulatory patients treated with 400/100 mg of LPV/RTV twice daily. A database of 1110 concentrations of LPV and RTV (647 from a single time-point and 463 from 73 full PK profiles) was available. Concentrations were determined at steady state using high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection. PK analysis was performed with NONMEM software. Age, gender, height, total body weight, body mass index, RTV trough concentration (RTC), hepatitis C virus coinfection, total bilirubin, hospital of origin, formulation and concomitant administration of efavirenz (EFV), saquinavir (SQV), atazanavir (ATV), and tenofovir were analyzed as possible covariates influencing LPV/RTV kinetic behavior. RESULTS: Population models were developed with 954 drug plasma concentrations from 201 patients, and the validation was conducted in the remaining 62 patients (156 concentrations). A 1-compartment model with first-order absorption (including lag-time) and elimination best described the PK. Proportional error models for interindividual and residual variability were used. The final models for the drugs oral clearance (CL/F) were as follows: CL/F(LPV)(L/h)=0.216 BMI 0.81(RTC) 1.25(EFV) 0.84(ATV); CL/F(RTV)(L/h) = 8.00 1.34(SQV) 1.77(EFV) 1.35(ATV). The predictive performance of the final population PK models was tested using standardized mean prediction errors, showing values of 0.03 +- 0.74 and 0.05 +- 0.91 for LPV and RTV, and normalized prediction distribution error, confirming the suitability of both models. CONCLUSIONS: These validated models could be implemented in clinical PK software and applied to dose individualization using a Bayesian approach for both drugs."
21978797,[Human immunodeficiency virus infection and viral hepatitis].,"Hepatic complications currently represent one of the leading reasons for medical consultations, hospitalisation, and death in the HIV-infected population. This is due to a large extent to viral hepatitis, given its disproportionate frequency in this population. Chronic hepatitis B affects 5-10% of the HIV-infected population. Vaccination has reduced the incidence of liver disease related to hepatitis-B virus (HBV), and the availability of tenofovir has dramatically improved the prognosis of HIV/HBV carriers. Delta hepatitis affects around 15% of HIV-infected individuals in Europe harbouring positive HBsAg. It has the worst prognosis, given its accelerated course to cirrhosis and the absence of successful therapy. Lastly, chronic hepatitis C is the major cause of liver disease in the HIV population. Although classically linked to persons infected parenterally (i.e., intravenous drug users), outbreaks of acute hepatitis C among homosexual men have been reported over the last decade. Treatment with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin provides a cure in less than 40% of patients. However, the introduction of new direct acting antivirals against hepatitis- C virus (HCV) (telaprevir, boceprevir) has revolutionised the field, as HAART did in 1996 in the HIV field, improving the prognosis of co-infected patients. However, interactions between these drugs and antiretroviral agents and the risk of selective resistance pose huge threats in this population."
22041467,Adherence to antiretroviral therapy and its correlates among HIV-infected children at an HIV clinic in New Delhi.,"BACKGROUND: With the introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART), the mortality and morbidity of HIV/AIDS have decreased markedly. However, high adherence to ART (>95%) is necessary for a good therapeutic outcome. There is a paucity of data on paediatric  adherence to ART and its correlates from developing countries, particularly India. AIM: To determine the rate of adherence to ART in HIV-infected Indian children and the factors associated with adherence. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at an ART clinic in  New Delhi, north India. Caregivers of 90 children were interviewed using a pre-designed, structured questionnaire and checklist. The primary measure of adherence was 4-day caregiver's recall. Adherence rates were correlated with 3-monthly CD4 counts. RESULTS: Mean (SD, range)  adherence was 91 4% (12 3, 75-100%). Adherence was low (<95%) in 31 (34 4%) patients. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, increasing time since ART initiation (OR 1 08, 95% CI 1 02-1 13), low caregiver educational status  (OR 4 19, 95% CI 1 37-10 88), orphanhood (OR 3 57, 95% CI 1 13-9 25), efavirenz-based ART regimens (OR 3 65, 95% CI 1 05-10 69) and female gender (OR 3 15, 95% CI 1 03-7 68) were  associated with lower adherence. The rise in CD4 count after ART initiation was more marked in the high adherence group, with the difference in the two groups becoming statistically significant after 6 months of ART (median CD4 count 698 vs 355, p=0 016). CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to achieve high adherence to ART in a resource-limited setting. Caregiver recall is a reliable and inexpensive tool for measuring adherence. Paediatric adherence to ART is influenced by numerous factors and larger studies are needed to address the issue in India."
22044856,A randomized clinical trial evaluating therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) for protease inhibitor-based regimens in antiretroviral-experienced HIV-infected individuals: week 48 results of the A5146 study.,"BACKGROUND: We devised an open-label, randomized trial to evaluate whether therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of protease inhibitors (PIs) and dose escalation based upon a normalized inhibitory quotient (NIQ), which integrates PI trough concentration and drug resistance, could improve virologic outcome in PI-experienced patients with treatment failure. Secondary analyses through 48 weeks are presented. METHODS: Eligible HIV-infected subjects with a screening viral load of >= 1000 copies/mL initiated a new PI-based regimen at entry and had NIQ performed at week 2. Subjects with an NIQ <=1 were randomized at week 4 to a standard-of-care (SOC) arm or TDM arm featuring PI dose escalation. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-three subjects were randomized. There was no significant treatment difference in change from randomization to week 48 in HIV-1 RNA [ P = .13, median (25th, 75th percentile log10 copies/mL change): -0.03 (-0.74, 0.62) with TDM and 0.11 (-2.3, 0.82) with SOC]. In subgroup analysis, patients with >= 0.69 active PIs benefited from TDM compared to those with <0.69 active PIs ( P = .05). CONCLUSIONS: While the TDM strategy of PI dose escalation did not improve virologic response at week 48 overall, in subgroup analysis, TDM favorably impacted virologic outcome in subjects taking PI-based regimens with moderate antiviral activity."
22074711,"Utility of routine viral load, CD4 cell count, and clinical monitoring among adults with HIV receiving antiretroviral therapy in Uganda: randomised trial.","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use of routine laboratory monitoring in terms of clinical outcomes among patients receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Uganda. DESIGN: Randomised clinical trial SETTING: A home based ART programme in rural Uganda. PARTICIPANTS: All participants were people with HIV who were members of the AIDS Support Organisation. Participants had CD4 cell counts <250 cells x 10(6)/L or World Health Organization stage 3 or 4 disease. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomised to one of three different monitoring arms: a viral load arm (clinical monitoring, quarterly CD4 counts, and viral load measurements), CD4 arm (clinical monitoring and CD4 counts), or clinical arm (clinical monitoring alone). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Serious morbidity (newly diagnosed AIDS defining illness) and mortality. RESULTS: 1094 participants started ART; median CD4 count at baseline was 129 cells x 10(6)/L. Median follow-up was three years. In total, 126 participants died (12%), 148 (14%) experienced new AIDS defining illnesses, and 61(6%) experienced virological failure, defined as two consecutive viral loads >500 copies/mL occurring more than three months after the start of ART. After adjustment for age, sex, baseline CD4 count, viral load, and body mass index, the rate of new AIDS defining events or death was higher in the clinical arm than the viral load arm (adjusted hazard ratio 1.83, P = 0.002) or the CD4 arm (1.49, P = 0.032). There was no significant difference between the CD4 arm and the viral load arm (1.23, P = 0.31). CONCLUSION: In patients receiving ART for HIV infection in Uganda, routine laboratory monitoring is associated with improved health and survival compared with clinical monitoring alone. Trial registration Clinical Trials NCT00119093."
22074712,Antiretroviral therapy programmes in resource limited settings.,
22080121,Immunologic criteria are poor predictors of virologic outcome: implications for HIV treatment monitoring in resource-limited settings.,"BACKGROUND: Viral load (VL) quantification is considered essential for determining antiretroviral treatment (ART) success in resource-rich countries. However, it is not widely available in resource-limited settings where the burden of human immunodeficiency virus infection is greatest. In the absence of VL monitoring, switches to second-line ART are based on World Health Organization (WHO) clinical or immunologic failure criteria. METHODS: We assessed the performance of CD4 cell criteria to predict virologic outcomes in a large ART program in Nigeria. Laboratory monitoring consists of CD4 cell count and VL at baseline, then every 6 months. Failure was defined as 2 consecutive VLs >1000 copies/mL after at least 6 months of ART. Virologic outcomes were compared with the 3 WHO-defined immunologic failure criteria. RESULTS: A total of 9690 patients were included in the analysis (median follow-up, 33.2 months). A total of 1225 patients experienced failure by both immunologic and virologic criteria, 872 by virologic criteria only, and 1897 by immunologic criteria only. The sensitivity of CD4 cell criteria to detect viral failure was 58%, specificity was 75%, and the positive-predictive value was 39%. For patients with both virologic and immunologic failure, VL criteria identified failure significantly earlier than CD4 cell criteria (median, 10.4 vs 15.6 months; P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Because of the low sensitivity of immunologic criteria, a substantial number of failures are missed, potentially resulting in accumulation of resistance mutations. In addition, specificity and predictive values are low, which may result in large numbers of unnecessary ART switches. Monitoring solely by immunologic criteria may result in increased costs because of excess switches to more expensive ART and development of drug-resistant virus."
22082287,Challenges in implementing HIV laboratory monitoring in resource-constrained settings: how to do more with less.,"Laboratory monitoring for HIV disease in resource-limited settings has now become one of the key challenges for antiretroviral treatment (ART) access and success, as emphasized by the 2010 revised WHO guidelines for ART in resource-limited settings. Thus, the most common method for initiating ART, and monitoring treatment response in resource-constrained environments is the measurement of CD4 T-cell count. Affordable CD4 T-cell counting has gradually been made possible by using simple, compact and robust, low-cost, new-generation cytometers, operating as single-platform volumetric instruments. Several cost-effective point-of-care CD4 T-cell testing options are also already on the market, in order to improve access to CD4 T-cell monitoring, especially for rural patients, and to reduce loss-to-follow-up of patients. In addition, HIV RNA viral load measurement is becoming increasingly important, mainly for a systematic confirmation of first-line ART failure before switching to second-line treatment to avoid belated as well as premature therapeutic decisions and their potentially negative consequences. Viral load testing should now be considered as the standard of care for therapeutic failure in all resource-limited settings. However, the measurement of HIV viral load remains a centralized marker, carried out in a limited number of reference laboratories. Finally, the costs of second-line ART regimens, rather than the laboratory test costs themselves, currently constitute the primary determinant of the total cost in ART switching. Laboratory monitoring strategies may become more attractive as price negotiations render second-line ART regimens less expensive worldwide."
22106227,Pregnancy-related effects on lamivudine pharmacokinetics in a population study with 228 women.,"The aim of this study was to describe lamivudine (3TC) pharmacokinetics (PK) in HIV-infected nonpregnant and pregnant women and their fetuses. Samples were collected according to therapeutic drug monitoring from 228 women treated with lamivudine and retrospectively analyzed by a population approach. The samples were also collected from cord blood and amniotic fluid at birth. Lamivudine pharmacokinetics were ascribed to an open two-compartment model with linear absorption and elimination. Mean population parameter estimates (intersubject variability) for women were an absorption rate constant of 1.04 h(-1), an elimination clearance rate of 23.6 (0.266) liters   h(-1), a central volume of distribution of 109 (0.897) liters, an intercompartmental clearance rate of 6.7 liters/h, and a peripheral volume of distribution of 129 liters. A fetal compartment was linked to maternal circulation by mother-to-cord (or fetus) and cord-to-mother rate constants of 0.463 h(-1) and 0.538 h(-1), respectively. The amniotic fluid compartment was connected to the fetal compartment with an elimination rate constant of 0.163 h(-1) and a fixed-constant swallowing flow. The placental transfer expressed as fetal-to-maternal area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) ratio was 0.86, and the lamivudine amniotic fluid accumulation, expressed as the amniotic fluid-to-fetal AUC ratio, was 2.9. Pregnant women had a 22% higher apparent clearance than nonpregnant and parturient women; however, this increase did not lead to subexposure and should not require a dosage adjustment."
22118500,Drug safety evaluation of  maraviroc  for the treatment of HIV infection.,"INTRODUCTION: Maraviroc is the only C-chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) antagonist approved for the treatment of infection with HIV. This article reviews the safety and efficacy of maraviroc in the treatment of HIV infection. AREAS COVERED: The PubMed database was searched using the keywords 'maraviroc' and 'HIV'. In addition, conference proceedings from CROI, IAS and EACS meetings were searched for maraviroc clinical trials. The PubMed search revealed one Phase IIb - III clinical trial in treatment-naive HIV(+) patients (MERIT) and three Phase IIb - III randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in treatment-experienced patients (MOTIVATE 1 and 2, A4001029). All RCTs showed an excellent safety profile for maraviroc in the treatment of HIV-1 infection. However, long-term (> 3 years) safety data generated on maraviroc therapy are still scarce. Based on the findings from RCTs so far, no relevant toxicities and co-morbidities such as coronary heart disease or hepatotoxicity have been described. The overall CD4(+) cell count increase resulting from a maraviroc-containing regimen appears to be higher than those seen with other antiretroviral regimens. However, the significance remains controversial. To date, maraviroc has shown a potent and durable virological efficacy profile for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. The only use of maraviroc depends on pretreatment testing for CCR5 tropism. EXPERT OPINION: Maraviroc is a generally safe and well-tolerated medication for the treatment of HIV-1 infection with a unique mechanism of action. Long-term (i.e., > 5 years) risks are not known and have to be carefully monitored."
22123690,Pregnancy-related effects on tenofovir pharmacokinetics: a population study with 186 women.,"According to the European AIDS Clinical Society, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate can be used in HIV-infected pregnant women if started prior to pregnancy, although no data are available on the pharmacokinetics of tenofovir (TFV) during pregnancy. The aim of this study was to describe TFV pharmacokinetics in HIV-infected women and to evaluate the effect of pregnancy on TFV disposition. Samples were collected according to a therapeutic drug monitoring in 186 women, including 46 pregnant women treated with TFV and retrospectively analyzed by a population approach. TFV pharmacokinetics were ascribed to an open two-compartment model with linear absorption and elimination. The mean population parameter estimates (between-subject variability) were as follows: absorption rate constant, 0.56 h(-1); elimination clearance, 59.9 liters h(-1) (0.436); central volume of distribution, 552 liters (1.96); intercompartmental clearance, 172 liters/h; and peripheral volume of distribution, 1,390 liters. Pregnant women had a 39% higher apparent clearance compared to nonpregnant women. Apparent clearance significantly decreased with age. In order to obtain an exposure similar to the known exposure in adults and guarantee similar trough concentrations (C(min)) as observed in adults, an increase in the TFV dose should be considered for women from the second trimester to delivery."
22135262,Baseline cellular HIV DNA load predicts HIV DNA decline and residual HIV plasma levels during effective antiretroviral therapy.,"Cellular human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) DNA may be considered a marker of disease progression with significant predictive power, but published data on its correlation with plasma HIV RNA levels and CD4 counts in acute and chronic patients are not conclusive. We evaluated a cohort of 180 patients naive for antiretroviral therapy before the beginning of treatment and after a virological response in order to define the indicators correlated with HIV DNA load decrease until undetectability. The following variables were evaluated as continuous variables: age, CD4 cell count and log(10) HIV DNA level at baseline and follow-up, and baseline log(10) HIV RNA level. Primary HIV infection at the start of therapy, an HIV RNA level at follow-up of <2.5 copies/ml, origin, gender, and transmission risk were evaluated as binary variables. The decline of HIV DNA values during effective therapy was directly related to baseline HIV DNA and HIV RNA values, to an increase in the number of CD4 cells, and to the achievement of an HIV RNA load of <2.5 copies/ml. An undetectable cellular HIV DNA load was achieved by 21.6% of patients at the follow-up time point and correlated significantly with lower baseline cellular HIV DNA values and with being in the primary stage of infection when therapy started. In conclusion, early treatment facilitated the achievement of undetectable levels of plasma viremia and cellular HIV DNA and a better recovery of CD4 lymphocytes. HIV DNA levels before and during highly active antiretroviral therapy may be used as a new tool for monitoring treatment efficacy."
22156777,Antiretroviral therapy in treatment-naive patients with HIV infection.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review discusses the current status of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in treatment-naive patients. ART initiation in such patients needs to be carefully planned, as the aim of therapy has shifted from prolonging life to ensuring maintained adherence to ART and optimization of quality of life. There is a plethora of first-line antiretroviral agents available, and physicians must consider several patient-related and therapy-related factors before selecting the most appropriate initial ART. RECENT FINDINGS: Current treatment guidelines recommend the use of nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (PI), or integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI)-based regimens in treatment-naive patients. Treatment selection and modification to achieve optimal response is based primarily on regular assessment of viral load (and resistance testing if necessary) and CD4 cell count. The use of genotypic resistance testing, on initiation of therapy and on treatment failure, is becoming more widespread. In selected patients, due to increasing transmitted drug resistance (TDR), a PI-based regimen may be a better option. Classic ART combinations are being challenged by new combinations, although there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend use of the newer over classic combinations. Co-formulations of drugs and single-tablet regimens are fast becoming available and their convenience may increase patient treatment adherence. SUMMARY: All drug classes currently available for first-line ART are efficacious and have good tolerability; however, differences between individual drugs must be carefully considered when deciding a first-line regimen. Each first-line regimen must be tailored to the individual patient to attain optimal efficacy, acceptable long-term tolerability, and good adherence to ART."
22180522,"Validity of self-report measures in assessing antiretroviral adherence of newly diagnosed, HAART-naive, HIV patients.","PURPOSE: To compare the performance of self-report instruments assessing adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in patients starting ART for the first time and in a predominately Hispanic population. METHODS: Of 184 patients in a prospective observational cohort study of newly diagnosed, minority patients of low socioeconomic status, 54 were given Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS) caps for their boosted protease inhibitor (PI) or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). They completed a 4-week recall visual analogue scale (VAS), the Adult AIDS Clinical Trial Group (AACTG) 4-day recall instrument, and a 1-month recall qualitative single-item measure every 3 months for up to 18 months in English or Spanish. Electronic pharmacy records recorded refill dates. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated to compare self-report measures with MEMS data and pharmacy data. RESULTS: Of 46 patients with MEMS data, mean adherence was 84.7% (SD 35.6) by MEMS, 84.5% (SD 15.1) by pharmacy, 95.4% (SD 11.9) by VAS, 95.8% (SD 17.2) by AACTG, and 87.6% (SD 28.2) by qualitative single item. The correlation coefficient (CC) of VAS with MEMS was 0.37 (P < .01), and with pharmacy it was 0.34 (P < .01). The CC of the AACTG with MEMS was 0.32 (P < .01), and with pharmacy it was 0.28 (P < .01). The qualitative single item had a CC with MEMS of 0.24 (P < .01) and with pharmacy of 0.32 (P < .01). Spanish-speaking patients' VAS adherence had a CC of 0.40 (P < .01) with MEMS. CONCLUSIONS: The VAS, AACTG, and qualitative single-item measures correlated significantly with MEMS and pharmacy data. Our data support self-administration of the VAS, even in Span-ish speakers."
22891448,"[Pharmacogenetics, a valuable aid to therapeutic monitoring of immunosuppressives and antiretrovirals].","Although very effective, some drugs have considerable side effects and are characterized by a relatively narrow therapeutic index. It is therefore sometimes required to regularly check their blood concentration in order to find the best compromise between optimal therapeutic efficacy and reduced toxicity. A therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is applied for immunosuppressants used in solid organ transplantation and for antiretrovirals used in the treatment of HIV infections. A first improvement of conventional TDM consists in trying to understand the origin of the inter-individual variability at the pharmacokinetic level in order to anticipate it and to propose individualized dose adjustment according to each patient's genetic characteristics. A complementary improvement consists in measuring the active biological dose of the drug directly in target tissues (lymphocytes for both pharmacological classes considered) and in studying genetic and other factors, influencing this parameter. In complement to conventional TDM, pharmacogenetics therefore allows a better individualization of drug therapy."
